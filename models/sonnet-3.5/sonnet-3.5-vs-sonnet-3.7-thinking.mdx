## Introduction

As software systems become increasingly complex, the necessity for accurate and efficient bug detection tools has intensified. Among the many candidates, reasoning models have been proposed as a promising alternative to traditional LLMs (Large Language Models). This blog post focuses on comparing two Anthropic models: the 3.5 Sonnet and the Sonnet 3.7 Thinking, with the latter introducing a "thinking step" before generating responses. This critical facet potentially augments their ability to dissect and understand complex code structures, making them invaluable for identifying elusive bugs in software programs.

## Results

Our comparative analysis pitted the Anthropic: 3.5 Sonnet against the Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 Thinking across five major programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. The results, extracted from detailed tests, reflect intriguing insights into their relative performances:

- **Python:**
  - 3.5 Sonnet: Detected 3 bugs out of a total of 42.
  - 3.7 Thinking: Caught 2 out of 42.

- **TypeScript:**
  - 3.5 Sonnet: Identified 3 bugs.
  - 3.7 Thinking: Managed to discover 9 bugs.

- **Go:**
  - 3.5 Sonnet: Uncovered 3 bugs.
  - 3.7 Thinking: Similarly found 3 bugs.

- **Rust:**
  - 3.5 Sonnet: Spotted 3 bugs out of 41.
  - 3.7 Thinking: Found 6 out of 41.

- **Ruby:**
  - 3.5 Sonnet: Detected 7 bugs.
  - 3.7 Thinking: Mirrored this with another 7.

Across these languages, Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 Thinking model notably excelled in TypeScript and Rust, showing a significant improvement in bug detection compared to its predecessor. In other languages, such as Python, both models had limited success, indicating the challenges posed by the languageâ€™s complex structure.

## Thoughts

The diverse results highlight the importance and impact of the "thinking step" introduced in the Sonnet 3.7 model. This additional processing phase translates to pronounced advantages, especially in languages like Rust and TypeScript, where logical bug discovery, as opposed to template or pattern recognition, plays a pivotal role. However, this advantage becomes less distinguishable in languages like Go or Ruby, where prior exposure to dataset-based learning suffices for bug detection, despite the complexity or reasoning required.

Our initial hypothesis posited that the thinking model would universally outperform due to its nuanced approach to problem-solving. The results resonate well with the predictions, albeit exhibiting the limitations in scenarios where traditional models perform adequately owing to extensive training datasets.

## Interesting Bugs

A particularly revealing bug was discovered within the Python category, specifically regarding program number 2. The Anthropic: 3.7 Thinking model successfully identified a bug involving asynchronous modifications to the `came_from` dictionary during path reconstruction, a scenario that could lead to inconsistent paths or infinite loops. The 3.5 Sonnet model failed to recognize this, underscoring the sophistication of the planning step in troubleshooting concurrent data access challenges.

```
2, True, "The most critical bug is that the function does not protect against asynchronous modifications to the `came_from` dictionary during path reconstruction, potentially leading to inconsistent paths or infinite loops."
```

This discrepancy exemplifies the nuanced analysis capabilities of the reasoning model, suggesting how its methodological introspection adds a tier of sophistication beyond static analysis.

## Conclusion

The comparative analysis between the Anthropic: 3.5 Sonnet and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 Thinking models has unveiled critical insights into how advanced AI-driven tools can be harnessed to improve software verification processes. Although both models exhibit strengths and weaknesses across various languages, the incorporation of a thinking phase undeniably augments the detection of nuanced logical errors. As AI evolves, the convergence of reasoning capabilities with extensive training datasets could signal a new horizon in efficient bug detection and software reliability.
