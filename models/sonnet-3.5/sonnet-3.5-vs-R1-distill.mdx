## Introduction

Bug detection in software code has always been a critical aspect of software engineering. As artificial intelligence continues to advance, leveraging large language models (LLMs) for this purpose has become an intriguing possibility. This blog post delves into a comparison between two such models: Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet and DeepSeek's R1 Distill Llama. Our primary focus is on their ability to detect hard-to-find bugs within software programs across various programming languages.

## Results

In our tests, both models were evaluated on how well they could identify a predetermined set of "hard bugs" across different programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. Here's a brief summary of the results:

- **Python:** Anthropic: 3.5 Sonnet detected 3 out of the 10 difficult bugs, whereas DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama also identified 3 out of 10. Both models exhibited similar performance in Python.
- **TypeScript:** Anthropic: 3.5 Sonnet detected 5 out of 10 bugs, while DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama identified 6 out of 10, slightly outperforming Sonnet in this language.
- **Go:** For Go, Sonnet detected 8 out of 10 bugs, whereas DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama identified 7 out of 10 bugs, indicating a slight edge for Sonnet in detecting bugs written in Go.
- **Rust:** Anthropic: 3.5 Sonnet caught 3 out of 10 bugs, while DeepSeek matched this performance in Rust.
- **Ruby:** Sonnet was able to identify 7 out of 10 bugs, as opposed to DeepSeek's 4 out of 10, giving Sonnet a noticeable advantage here.

Overall, Anthropic's Sonnet showed more prowess in identifying bugs, particularly in Ruby and Go, whereas the performance was comparable for Python and Rust. DeepSeek's model slightly edged out Sonnet in TypeScript.

## Thoughts

The results indicate that each model has varying capabilities across different programming languages, suggesting that the training data and methodology may significantly impact the models' proficiencies in specific domains. Sonnet's superior performance in Ruby and Go might derive from its more extensive exposure to idiomatic usage and common bug patterns specific to those languages during training. Conversely, DeepSeek's slight lead in TypeScript may indicate its training data had more comprehensive TypeScript content or better model tuning for this language.

While both models performed inconsistently across the language spectrum, this is a promising indication that LLMs can indeed assist in bug detection. However, their current limitations in consistently outperforming traditional bug detection tools emphasize the need for further iterations in model development and training.

## Interesting Bugs

Examining the bugs each model detected provides insight into their respective strengths. One compelling bug was test number 7 in the Ruby language, which involved a critical issue in an audio processing library's gain calculation:

Anthropic's 3.5 Sonnet managed to catch this bug:

- **Bug Description:** The bug was located in the TimeStretchProcessor class, where it failed to adjust the gain based on audio stretching, leading to incorrect amplitude. Sonnet noted that the gain adjustment utilized a fixed formula rather than scaling with the stretch factor, causing amplified audio errors.

- **Reasoning Output:** Sonnet was able to reason that the gain adjustment should be proportional to the audio stretch to maintain consistent amplitude levels, identifying the mathematical inconsistency causing the bug.

The reasoning demonstrates Sonnet's capability to understand complex logical requirements within the code beyond surface-level syntax errors. This particular bug was noteworthy as it encapsulated a logic issue which required a deeper contextual understanding to solveâ€”a task well suited for Sonnet's reasoning capabilities.

In conclusion, the tested models show promising starts in the realm of bug detection, with areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Their performances serve as a baseline for what AI-driven bug detection can achieve when further refined and specialized for software engineering tasks.
