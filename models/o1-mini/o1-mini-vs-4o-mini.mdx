## üß† Introduction

AI-assisted code generation has made huge strides‚Äîbut what about **AI-powered code review**?

In this post, we compare **OpenAI‚Äôs o1-mini** and **4o-mini**, two compact LLMs, on their ability to detect **real bugs** in real code. Unlike generation, bug detection requires understanding logic, context, and intent. It‚Äôs a different kind of challenge‚Äîone that tests a model‚Äôs reasoning capabilities.


## üß™ The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td

			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## üìä Results

We ran both models on a benchmark of **210 buggy programs** across five languages: Go, Python, TypeScript, Rust, and Ruby.

- **o1-mini**: 11 bugs detected  
- **4o-mini**: 19 bugs detected

### By Language

- **Go**:  
  - o1-mini: 2  
  - 4o-mini: 3

- **Python**:  
  - o1-mini: 2  
  - 4o-mini: 4

- **TypeScript**:  
  - o1-mini: 1  
  - 4o-mini: 2

- **Rust**:  
  - o1-mini: 2  
  - 4o-mini: 4

- **Ruby**:  
  - o1-mini: 4  
  - 4o-mini: 6

In every language, 4o-mini outperformed o1-mini. The gaps weren‚Äôt massive‚Äîbut they were consistent, pointing to a general edge in bug detection.

## üí° Interpretation

The difference likely comes down to **reasoning**.

- **o1-mini** relies more heavily on pattern recognition. It performs reasonably well when bugs resemble known structures or common mistakes‚Äîespecially in syntactically predictable languages.
- **4o-mini** shows signs of deeper logical reasoning. It performs better in high-context situations where identifying a bug means **understanding what the code is supposed to do**, not just what it looks like.

That ability to generalize‚Äîrather than just memorize‚Äîgives 4o-mini an edge, particularly in languages like Ruby or Rust, where logic often deviates from obvious patterns.

## üêû A Bug Worth Highlighting

**Test 1: Gain Calculation in Ruby Audio Library**

In a `TimeStretchProcessor` class, a bug involved miscalculating `normalize_gain`. Instead of scaling based on `stretch_factor`, the code used a fixed value‚Äîresulting in audio that was too loud or too quiet depending on speed.

- **o1-mini** missed it  
- **4o-mini** flagged it

This wasn‚Äôt a syntax issue. It was a **logic error in audio domain math**, requiring the model to reason about the effect of one variable (`stretch_factor`) on another (`gain`). 4o-mini connected the dots‚Äîo1-mini didn‚Äôt.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Both models are fast, compact, and useful‚Äîbut **4o-mini is clearly stronger** for AI code review.

Its consistent improvement across languages‚Äîand its ability to reason through logic and intent‚Äîmake it a better choice for detecting the kind of bugs that matter in production.

As AI continues to improve, we expect this trend to grow: the best AI reviewers won‚Äôt just recognize patterns‚Äîthey‚Äôll **think**.
