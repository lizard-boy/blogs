As AI continues to reshape how we write and review code, its ability to **detect bugs** â€” not just generate syntax â€” is becoming increasingly important. In this post, we compare two compact but capable models: **OpenAIâ€™s o1-mini** and **Metaâ€™s Llama-3.1 405B**, focusing specifically on their performance in spotting subtle, real-world software bugs.


## ðŸ§ª The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td
					style={{

			</tr>

	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## ðŸ“Š Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **Meta Llama-3.1 405B**: 24  
- **OpenAI o1-mini**: 11

**By Language**
- **Python**: o1-mini found 2, Llama-3.1 found 5  
- **TypeScript**: o1-mini found 1, Llama-3.1 found 8  
- **Go**: o1-mini found 2, Llama-3.1 found 5  
- **Rust**: o1-mini found 2, Llama-3.1 found 1  
- **Ruby**: o1-mini found 4, Llama-3.1 found 5

Metaâ€™s model outperformed OpenAIâ€™s in 4 of 5 languages â€” most significantly in TypeScript and Go. Rust was the only exception, where o1-mini edged ahead.

## ðŸ§  Interpretation

The performance gap likely reflects differences in architecture and training focus:

- **Meta Llama-3.1 405B** appears to follow a **reasoning-first approach**, likely including a planning or thinking step before generating responses. This gives it an advantage in identifying logical bugs, especially in less straightforward domains like audio processing or concurrency.
  
- **OpenAI o1-mini**, by contrast, leans on **pattern matching**. In languages where training data is abundant (like Rust or Python), this works reasonably well â€” but it struggles when bug detection requires more than recognizing familiar patterns.

That explains why Llama-3.1 pulled ahead in TypeScript and Ruby â€” both of which often require deeper logic tracking due to flexible syntax and hidden side effects.

## ðŸ§© A Bug Worth Highlighting

**Test Case 1 â€” Ruby: Gain Calculation in Audio Processing**

A critical bug existed in the `TimeStretchProcessor` class, where the `normalize_gain` value was **not adjusted based on the `stretch_factor`**. This led to incorrect amplitude levels in the output audio.

- **Llama-3.1 405B caught it**  
- **o1-mini missed it**

Llamaâ€™s reasoning output explained:
> "Instead of adjusting the gain based on the stretch_factorâ€”which represents how much the audio is being sped up or slowed downâ€”it uses a fixed formula."

Spotting this bug required more than syntax matching â€” it required understanding how gain should scale with time. Llama-3.1 correctly inferred the logical consequence, while o1-mini overlooked the flaw.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

**Metaâ€™s Llama-3.1 405B clearly outperformed OpenAIâ€™s o1-mini** in this evaluation â€” especially in languages and bug types that benefit from structured reasoning over raw pattern recognition.

That said, o1-mini is fast, efficient, and competent in languages like Rust, where training data coverage is strong.

If you're choosing an LLM for bug detection:
- Use **Llama-3.1** for logic-heavy or asynchronous systems.
- Use **o1-mini** where speed and pattern-matching suffice.
