As AI tools mature, more teams are looking to use LLMs not just for generating code—but for **reviewing** it. In this post, we compare two lightweight AI models—**OpenAI o1-mini** and **DeepSeek v3**—on their ability to detect **hard bugs** in code across multiple languages.

Bug detection requires reasoning, control flow understanding, and semantic alignment. So which model does it better?


## 🧪 The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

<table
	style={{
		borderCollapse: 'collapse',
		width: '100%',

	}}>

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td
					style={{
						padding: '1rem',

					}}>
					{row[1]}
				</td>
			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## 📊 Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **DeepSeek v3**: 27  
- **OpenAI o1-mini**: 11

**By Language**
- **Python**:  
  - DeepSeek: 8  
  - o1-mini: 2  

- **TypeScript**:  
  - DeepSeek: 4  
  - o1-mini: 1  

- **Go**:  
  - DeepSeek: 5  
  - o1-mini: 2  

- **Rust**:  
  - DeepSeek: 5  
  - o1-mini: 2  

- **Ruby**:  
  - DeepSeek: 5  
  - o1-mini: 4  

DeepSeek v3 outperformed o1-mini in every language—sometimes dramatically (Python, Rust), sometimes modestly (Ruby).

## 💡 Analysis

The consistent edge for DeepSeek v3 comes down to one thing: **reasoning**.

- **o1-mini** relies on pattern recognition. It performs adequately in languages with high training coverage like Python or TypeScript—but struggles in cases where identifying a bug requires more than matching known patterns.
- **DeepSeek v3** appears to run a planning step before generating output. That means it can trace logic, evaluate consequences, and flag bugs that are harder to detect from syntax alone.

This shows up especially in Rust and Go, where reasoning through concurrency and data flow is key—and in Python, where semantic context often determines correctness.

## 🐞 A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test #2 — Go: Race Condition in State Sync

In a Go-based smart home backend, the `NotifyDeviceUpdate` method failed to properly lock device state before broadcasting changes—creating a **race condition**.

- **o1-mini** missed it  
- **DeepSeek v3** caught it

**DeepSeek’s output**:
> "There is a lack of synchronization around state updates, which could lead to clients receiving stale or partially updated device state during concurrent broadcasts."

Spotting this bug required understanding **async behavior**, shared state, and timing. DeepSeek abstracted that correctly—o1-mini did not.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This benchmark makes it clear: **DeepSeek v3 is the stronger model** for AI-powered bug detection today.

- Use **DeepSeek** for better logic coverage, especially in languages with structural nuance or asynchronous behavior.
- Use **o1-mini** when you need speed or a baseline model for simpler tasks.

As reasoning-first LLMs continue to improve, we expect this performance gap to widen—especially in areas like concurrency, flow control, and domain-specific logic.
