Bug detection is a fundamentally different task from code generation. Instead of generating clean syntax, models must understand intent, reason about logic, and identify subtle mistakes that might escape even experienced developers. In this post, we compare **OpenAIâ€™s o1-mini** and **Metaâ€™s Llama-3.3 70B** to evaluate how well they catch real-world bugs across five programming languages.


## ðŸ§ª The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## ðŸ“Š Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **Meta Llama-3.3 70B**: 17 bugs  
- **OpenAI o1-mini**: 11 bugs

**By Language**
- **Python**: o1-mini 2, Llama-3.3 1  
- **TypeScript**: o1-mini 1, Llama-3.3 5  
- **Go**: o1-mini 2, Llama-3.3 3  
- **Rust**: o1-mini 2, Llama-3.3 3  
- **Ruby**: o1-mini 4, Llama-3.3 5

Llama-3.3 70B outperformed o1-mini in four of five languages â€” with the biggest margin in TypeScript. o1-mini edged ahead only in Python.

## ðŸ§  Interpretation

The variation in performance can be explained by the modelsâ€™ underlying design:

- **o1-mini** appears optimized for **speed and pattern recognition**. In high-frequency training languages like Python, it does reasonably well, relying on familiar bug patterns.
- **Llama-3.3 70B**, while larger and slower, seems to rely more on **reasoning**. Itâ€™s able to follow logical flows and infer intent even when surface patterns donâ€™t help â€” especially useful in TypeScript and Ruby.

This mirrors a common theme across evaluations:  
- **Pattern-matching models** like o1-mini succeed in common codebases.  
- **Reasoning-first models** like Llama-3.3 perform better on unfamiliar structures or bugs that require deduction.

## ðŸ§© A Bug Worth Highlighting

**Test Case â€” Ruby: Gain Calculation in Audio Processing**

In the `TimeStretchProcessor` class, a bug caused the `normalize_gain` to remain constant â€” failing to scale with the `stretch_factor`. The result: inconsistent audio volume depending on how much the sample was sped up or slowed down.

- **Llama-3.3 caught it**  
- **o1-mini missed it**

Llamaâ€™s output highlighted the missing logic:
> "Instead of adjusting the gain based on the stretch_factorâ€”which represents how much the audio is being sped up or slowed downâ€”it uses a fixed formula."

Spotting this issue required understanding both **numerical reasoning** and **intent** â€” not just syntax. Llamaâ€™s ability to simulate the intended behavior helped it succeed where o1-mini faltered.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

This benchmark shows that **Metaâ€™s Llama-3.3 70B outperforms OpenAIâ€™s o1-mini** in detecting logic bugs across most languages â€” particularly where surface-level pattern matching falls short.

That said:
- **o1-mini** is smaller, faster, and solid for high-data languages like Python.
- **Llama-3.3** is better for reasoning-heavy, less common language cases like Ruby and TypeScript.

As AI code reviewers evolve, the tradeoff between **pattern recognition and logical deduction** will define which model performs better â€” and for whom.
