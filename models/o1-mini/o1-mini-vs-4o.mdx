While AI models are increasingly capable of generating code, their ability to **detect real bugs** is a much harder test ‚Äî one that requires understanding logic, control flow, and intent. In this post, we benchmark two models from OpenAI ‚Äî **o1-mini** and **4o** ‚Äî to evaluate how well they catch **hard bugs** across five programming languages.


## üß™ The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td

			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## üìä Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **o1-mini**: 11 bugs  
- **4o**: 20 bugs

That‚Äôs nearly a **2√ó improvement** with 4o over o1-mini.

### By Language

- **Go**:  
  - o1-mini: 2  
  - 4o: 4  

- **Python**:  
  - o1-mini: 2  
  - 4o: 6  

- **TypeScript**:  
  - o1-mini: 1  
  - 4o: 4  

- **Rust**:  
  - o1-mini: 2  
  - 4o: 3  

- **Ruby**:  
  - o1-mini: 4  
  - 4o: 3  

While 4o outperformed o1-mini in most languages, **Ruby was the exception** ‚Äî where o1-mini actually performed better.

## üí° Interpretation

The results reveal a clear trend: **4o‚Äôs reasoning capabilities give it an edge** in detecting subtle bugs, especially in Python and TypeScript ‚Äî languages where logic and context often matter more than syntax alone.

- **o1-mini** does better when pattern recognition alone is enough ‚Äî or when it happens to have better representation in training data, as may be the case with Ruby.
- **4o** appears better equipped for **reasoning-first detection**, catching bugs that require planning and inference rather than just matching syntax or familiar patterns.

That said, the Ruby result is interesting. o1-mini catching more bugs there may suggest:
- Better memorization of common Ruby bug patterns  
- More favorable tuning for Ruby's syntax  
- Or simply noise due to low absolute bug counts

In any case, 4o‚Äôs improvement across the board ‚Äî even modestly in Rust and Go ‚Äî suggests that **reasoning gives it broader generalization**.

## üêû A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test #1 ‚Äî Ruby: Audio Processing Logic Bug

In the `TimeStretchProcessor` class of a Ruby audio library, a bug appeared in the `normalize_gain` calculation. The gain was fixed, rather than scaled based on the `stretch_factor`. This caused output amplitude to swing wildly depending on how much the sample was sped up or slowed down.

- **o1-mini caught the bug**  
- **4o missed it**

This was one of the rare cases where **pattern recognition outperformed reasoning**. o1-mini likely recognized the bug from similar training patterns involving formula-based gain miscalculations.

It‚Äôs a great reminder: **reasoning helps generalize**, but **pattern familiarity still matters** ‚Äî especially for domain-specific or numerical errors.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

While both models have their strengths, **OpenAI 4o clearly performs better overall** for AI code review ‚Äî especially for languages and bug types that benefit from logical deduction over rote memorization.

- Use **4o** if you want better detection coverage across languages and logic-heavy bugs  
- Use **o1-mini** if you want a lighter, faster model and can tolerate lower accuracy
