AI models are getting better at writing code—but how well can they catch **real bugs**? In this post, we evaluate two compact LLMs: **OpenAI’s o1-mini** and **DeepSeek’s R1 Distill**, focusing on their ability to detect hard-to-spot bugs across five programming languages.

Bug detection is a tougher task than code generation. It requires understanding not just what code is, but what it's trying to do—and where it might go wrong.


## 🧪 The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

Here are the programs we used for the evaluation:

<table
	style={{
		borderCollapse: 'collapse',
		width: '100%',
		margin: '2rem 0',
		borderRadius: '8px',
		overflow: 'hidden',
		fontSize: '0.95rem',
		lineHeight: '1.5'
	}}>
	<thead>
		<tr>

				}}>
				ID
			</th>

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td
					style={{
						padding: '1rem',
						borderBottom: '1px solid var(--tw-prose-border, #e2e8f0)',

				</td>
				<td

					}}>
					{row[1]}
				</td>
			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \response\ variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## 📊 Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **DeepSeek R1 Distill**: 37  
- **OpenAI o1-mini**: 11

**By Language**
- **Python**: DeepSeek 4, o1-mini 2  
- **TypeScript**: DeepSeek 9, o1-mini 1  
- **Go**: DeepSeek 6, o1-mini 2  
- **Rust**: DeepSeek 9, o1-mini 2  
- **Ruby**: DeepSeek 9, o1-mini 4

DeepSeek **outperformed o1-mini across every language**, with its largest gains in TypeScript, Rust, and Ruby.

## 💡 Analysis

The results point to a consistent theme: **DeepSeek R1 Distill’s reasoning-first approach gives it a clear edge**.

- **o1-mini** is fast and lightweight, but relies heavily on pattern recognition. This works in high-data languages like Python—but breaks down when bugs require inference, logic, or domain context.
- **DeepSeek**, by contrast, uses a structured reasoning step before generating output. This allows it to detect bugs that go beyond syntax—especially in languages with less predictable structure (like Ruby or Rust).

In TypeScript and Go, DeepSeek’s ability to trace logic flow and identify logical mismatches gave it a notable advantage. In Ruby, it was particularly strong at spotting math or audio-processing errors that required semantic reasoning.

## 🐞 A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test 1 — Ruby: TimeStretchProcessor Logic Flaw

In a Ruby audio processing class, the normalize_gain value was calculated using a **fixed formula**, instead of adjusting for the stretch_factor. The result: audio playback with wildly inconsistent volume.

- **DeepSeek caught the bug**  
- **o1-mini missed it**

DeepSeek’s reasoning:
> "The gain calculation did not adjust dynamically to the stretch factor, leading to inconsistent amplitude levels in the output audio."

This wasn’t a syntax issue—it was a conceptual flaw. DeepSeek successfully connected audio scaling logic with mathematical behavior, a step beyond surface-level pattern detection.

## ✅ Conclusion

This benchmark clearly demonstrates that **DeepSeek R1 Distill outperforms OpenAI o1-mini** in bug detection—especially in real-world tasks that demand reasoning, context understanding, and multi-step logic.

- Choose **o1-mini** if you need speed and low compute.
- Choose **DeepSeek** if accuracy matters—particularly in languages or domains where bugs aren’t obvious.
