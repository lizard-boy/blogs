## Introduction

Detecting hard bugs in software programs is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring the reliability and security of applications. Traditional methods and tools often fall short in identifying complex, logic-based bugs. As Language Learning Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, their application in code analysis and bug detection has become increasingly relevant. This blog post examines the performance of two prominent models, OpenAI: 4.1 and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.5, in their ability to spot challenging bugs in software programs, highlighting their efficacy across several programming languages.

## Results

In our comparative study, both models were tasked with identifying bugs across five different programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. Here's a breakdown of our findings:

**Overall Results:**

- **OpenAI: 4.1:** Correctly identified bugs in 16 out of 209 cases.
- **Anthropic: Sonnet 3.5:** Correctly identified bugs in 26 out of 209 cases.

**Results by Language:**

- **Python:**  
  - OpenAI: 0/42  
  - Anthropic: 3/42

- **TypeScript:**  
  - OpenAI: 1/42  
  - Anthropic: 5/42

- **Go:**  
  - OpenAI: 4/42  
  - Anthropic: 8/42

- **Rust:**  
  - OpenAI: 7/41  
  - Anthropic: 3/41

- **Ruby:**  
  - OpenAI: 4/42  
  - Anthropic: 7/42

The results indicate that Anthropic: Sonnet 3.5 generally outperformed OpenAI: 4.1 in identifying bugs. Notably, its ability to catch bugs was consistent across most languages, except for Rust, where OpenAI showed a slightly better performance.

## Thoughts

The results from the tests suggest that the reasoning capability embedded in Anthropic: Sonnet 3.5 provides it an edge over OpenAI: 4.1 in identifying complex bugs. The "thinking," or reasoning step inherent in Anthropicâ€™s approach, likely aids in better understanding and detecting logic errors, especially in languages less dominated by data, like Ruby and Go. This capability seems less impactful in languages like Python where the existing data likely supports traditional error pattern recognition.

It is plausible that OpenAI's model, which might focus more on rapid generation without an explicit reasoning step, struggles with understanding intricate logic as successfully as the reasoning model. However, its performance in Rust shows that it can still perform well under certain contexts, possibly due to its pattern recognition abilities in dealing with less ambiguous code constructs commonly found in strongly typed languages like Rust.

## Interesting Bugs

One of the intriguing cases involved a complex bug in a Ruby audio processing library which involved incorrect gain calculation based on the stretch factor. Here's an excerpt of how the models performed:

**Test Number: 1**  
**Bug Description:** The calculation incorrectly used a fixed formula for gain adjustment, resulting in the wrong audio amplitude. The correct approach would involve scaling the gain relative to the stretch factor.

**Model Output:**  
- **OpenAI: 4.1:** Failed to detect this bug.  
- **Anthropic: Sonnet 3.5:** Successfully caught this issue, demonstrating the benefit of the reasoning step in scenarios requiring deeper logical analysis.

This specific bug highlights the added advantage of reasoning models in deducing the relational dependencies in code logic, which are often crucial in correctly identifying such subtle, yet impactful bugs.

## Conclusion

Both OpenAI: 4.1 and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.5 show promise as tools for catching hard bugs in software, but the latter currently appears better suited for tasks requiring logical deduction across multiple languages, with clear exceptions observed. As these models continue to evolve, the integration of faster computation capabilities with profound reasoning steps may further enhance the future of automated software verification.
