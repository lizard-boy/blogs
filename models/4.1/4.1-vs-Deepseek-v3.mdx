## Introduction

With the ever-increasing complexity of software systems, detecting bugs within code has transformed from a cumbersome manual process into a sophisticated challenge for AI-powered solutions. Recently, we conducted tests using two prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) - DeepSeek v3 and OpenAI 4.1 - to evaluate their prowess in identifying hard-to-catch bugs across multiple programming languages. Bug detection demands not only a detailed understanding of language syntax but also the ability to reason through logic errors and runtime issues, pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve.

## Results

We tested these models on a suite consisting of 210 software bugs, spread across five programming languages: Go, Python, TypeScript, Rust, and Ruby. In total, DeepSeek v3 successfully identified 17 bugs, while OpenAI 4.1 caught 23, showcasing a superior overall performance by the latter.

- **Go:** DeepSeek v3 caught 5 out of 42 bugs, with OpenAI 4.1 identifying a slightly fewer 4 out of 42.
- **Python:** Here, the results were markedly different. DeepSeek v3 successfully identified 8 of the 42 bugs, whereas OpenAI 4.1 failed to catch any bugs.
- **TypeScript:** DeepSeek v3 effectively identified 4 out of 42 bugs, in contrast to OpenAI 4.1, which identified just 1 bug.
- **Rust:** OpenAI 4.1 took the lead in Rust, catching 7 out of 41 bugs, compared to DeepSeek v3's 5.
- **Ruby:** DeepSeek v3 and OpenAI 4.1 both demonstrated equal performance by identifying 5 out of 42 bugs each.

The dispersion in performance by language hints at underlying model training biases, where language-specific structure and example abundance could lead models to different levels of competence.

## Thoughts

The disparity in results between DeepSeek v3 and OpenAI 4.1 can largely be attributed to differences in training datasets and respective model architectures. While OpenAI 4.1 showcases a broader understanding, managing to outperform DeepSeek v3 in total bugs caught, DeepSeek v3 shines particularly in Python, where it capitalizes on potential structural quirks and dataset differences. 

DeepSeek v3’s performance in Python and TypeScript may stem from a more nuanced dataset training in those languages, enabling it to recognize less common bugs. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s superior edge in Rust is likely due to advanced token analysis and pattern recognition capabilities that align well with the language’s memory safety and concurrency features.

Models’ reasoning process also plays a substantial role. In languages like Ruby, where pattern matching may not effectively catch nuanced bugs, logical reasoning employed by LLMs in deducing structured problems may be the trump card, as seen with DeepSeek v3's performance. The test results suggest an industry poised on the brink of achieving near-expert-level bug detection through LLMs, indicative of promising enhancements to software verification processes.

## Interesting Bugs

Taking Python as a case study - where DeepSeek v3 caught a bug that OpenAI 4.1 missed: 

**Test Number 7**

- **Program**: Blockchain.vote
- **Bug Caught by DeepSeek v3**: "The most critical bug is in `Blockchain.cast_vote`: it passes an empty string as the voter's private key to `self.add_transaction(...)`, which causes the transaction signature to be invalid or raises an exception when trying to sign, resulting in failed or insecure vote recording."
- **Reasoning**: DeepSeek v3 correctly identifies issues that involve cryptographic operations and integrity considerations, noting the importance of a valid signature for transaction authenticity - a fundamental requirement in blockchain operations.

In contrast, OpenAI 4.1’s failure to identify this bug highlights a potential gap in its understanding of security implementations and proper handling of sensitive cryptographic functions. This case reiterates the importance of a model's capability in contextual understanding beyond mere syntax and logic, reaching into practical application integrity.

The continuous evolution and improvement of LLMs in bug detection forms a pathway to increasingly autonomous and intelligent coding environments, ultimately revolutionizing what AI can achieve in software reliability and security.
