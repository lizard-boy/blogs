## Introduction

In the ever-expanding realm of software development, ensuring the detection and rectification of hard bugs in code is crucial. The introduction of AI models into this arena promises to automate and enhance bug detection, making software more reliable and secure. In this blog post, we compare two leading language models: OpenAI's 4o-mini and DeepSeek's R1, focusing on their ability to identify hard bugs within software programs. Through a series of tests conducted across multiple programming languages, we aimed to evaluate and understand the strength and weaknesses of these models in detecting complex software bugs.

## Results

During our evaluation, we ran tests on 42 software programs across five languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. We explored how effectively each model could discover bugs, especially focusing on more challenging issues that require deeper reasoning.

Across the board:
- **OpenAI: 4o-mini** discovered bugs in 19/210 programs, illustrating consistent coverage.
- **DeepSeek: R1** also discovered bugs in 23/210 programs, maintaining parity in overall bug discovery capability.

When analyzed by individual languages:
- **Go**
  - DeepSeek: R1 caught 3 out of 42 bugs.
  - OpenAI: 4o-mini caught 3 out of 42 bugs.
  
- **Python**
  - DeepSeek: R1 caught 3 out of 42 bugs.
  - OpenAI: 4o-mini managed 4 out of 42 bugs, showing a slight edge.
  
- **TypeScript**
  - DeepSeek: R1 caught 6 out of 42 bugs.
  - OpenAI: 4o-mini was less effective here, catching only 2 out of 42 bugs.
  
- **Rust**
  - DeepSeek: R1 successfully identified 7 out of 41 bugs.
  - OpenAI: 4o-mini caught 4 out of 41 bugs.
  
- **Ruby**
  - DeepSeek: R1 caught 4 out of 42 bugs.
  - OpenAI: 4o-mini discovered 6 out of 42 bugs, showing its strength in Ruby.

## Thoughts

Upon reviewing the results, it's evident that both models have strengths in different areas. OpenAI's 4o-mini is slightly better at covering Python and Ruby bugs, likely due to a broader contextual understanding and pattern recognition derived from extensive training data in those languages. In contrast, DeepSeek's R1 seems to fare better with TypeScript and Rust, suggesting an aptitude for languages with more distinctive syntactical rules, possibly due to better reasoning capabilities in handling complex language-specific patterns.

The variation in performance across languages could be attributed to the differences in language structures and the diversity of training data these models were exposed to. Additionally, OpenAI's slightly higher accuracy in Python could be because it is one of the most common languages, hence, models might have encountered it more during their training phase.

## Interesting Bugs

One of the most interesting bugs was within a Rust program (Test Number: 7). DeepSeek: R1 managed to catch an intricate logical flaw related to concurrency, while OpenAI: 4o-mini did not. Here is the output reasoning provided by DeepSeek: R1:

```
"The code has a race condition in KBucket.add_peer where 
the delayed peer replacement check (via `threading.Timer`) 
accesses a potentially modified bucket state, risking incorrect 
peer eviction or bucket overfilling due to unsynchronized 
concurrent modifications."
```

DeepSeek: R1 accurately identifies a race condition, which requires understanding of concurrent operationsâ€”a challenging aspect for automated models. The ability to foresee issues that depend on thread timing and synchronization nuances demonstrates DeepSeek's reasoning prowess in certain use cases. OpenAI: 4o-mini's miss here could be tied to potential shortcomings in processing multi-threaded contexts within some programming paradigms.

In conclusion, as these models continue to evolve, they offer promising support for developers tackling complex issues, fostering an environment for rapid, reliable software development.
