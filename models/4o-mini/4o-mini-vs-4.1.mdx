## Introduction

Detecting hard bugs in software programs is a crucial task that requires sophisticated tools and models. With advancements in AI, the ability of large language models (LLMs) to not only generate code but also find bugs has become a subject of interest. In this post, we examine two models from OpenAI—4o-mini and 4.1—both tasked with finding complex bugs across different programming languages. As these models are at the cutting edge of AI's interaction with code analysis and generation, this test serves as an important marker of their capabilities and potential uses in software verification.

## Results

The comparison involved running tests on OpenAI's LLMs, specifically 4o-mini and 4.1, to identify bugs in 210 challenging scenarios. Overall, 4o-mini identified 19 bugs while 4.1 identified 16. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- **Go Data:**  
  - OpenAI 4.1: 4/42 bugs caught  
  - OpenAI 4o-mini: 3/42 bugs caught

- **Python Data:**  
  - OpenAI 4.1: 0/42 bugs caught  
  - OpenAI 4o-mini: 4/42 bugs caught

- **TypeScript Data:**  
  - OpenAI 4.1: 1/42 bugs caught  
  - OpenAI 4o-mini: 2/42 bugs caught

- **Rust Data:**  
  - OpenAI 4.1: 7/41 bugs caught  
  - OpenAI 4o-mini: 4/41 bugs caught

- **Ruby Data:**  
  - OpenAI 4.1: 4/42 bugs caught  
  - OpenAI 4o-mini: 6/42 bugs caught

While OpenAI 4.1 had a consistently better performance across most languages, 4o-mini demonstrated its strength in Python and Ruby, suggesting language-specific optimization or a better handling of less common cases in these particular languages.

## Thoughts

The results highlighted a few interesting observations. OpenAI 4.1 was more adept in identifying bugs in Go and Rust, languages known for their unique functionalities compared to more widely used ones like Python and JavaScript derivatives such as TypeScript. This may be attributed to 4.1's training data having a broader exposure to these languages or optimized reasoning capabilities that better understand their syntax and semantics. Meanwhile, 4o-mini showed unexpected strength in Python, where it identified more bugs than 4.1, possibly due to better pattern recognition in commonly encountered Python bugs or its ability to deeply understand Python-specific idioms. 

For Ruby, a language with less mainstream exposure, 4o-mini's enhanced reasoning processes seemed to give it the upper hand, allowing it to better handle its dynamically typed nature and peculiarities. This variance suggests that LLM design impacts how it interacts with the specific nuances of different programming languages, indicating the potential for tailored LLMs that target particular programming environments for bug detection.

## Interesting Bugs

A notable instance where OpenAI 4.1 outperformed 4o-mini was in a bug related to a Ruby audio processing library:

**Test Number: 1**  
**Bug Description:** In the `TimeStretchProcessor` class, the `normalize_gain` calculation was erroneous as it didn't adjust the gain based on `stretch_factor`. This oversight led to incorrect audio amplitude.

**OpenAI 4.1 Output:** It successfully identified this critical flaw, recognizing the need to modify `normalize_gain` relative to `stretch_factor` to ensure consistent audio levels.

**OpenAI 4o-mini Output:** Unfortunately, it missed the bug, possibly due to its limited exposure or its more general approach that didn't align with Ruby’s variable and execution context distinctiveness.

This example underscores OpenAI 4.1’s heightened ability to recognize nuanced flaws, leveraging its planning and reasoning abilities enhanced for particular technical contexts such as audio processing in Ruby. It suggests that while faster, more generalized models like 4o-mini have their use cases, specialized logic and deeper problem-solving steps might yield better results in complex bug detection scenarios, showcasing the breadth of capabilities and potential improvements still to be explored within AI-driven code analysis.
