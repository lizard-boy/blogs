## Introduction

Bug detection remains one of the critical challenges in software development, significantly differing from tasks like code generation. While large language models (LLMs) have proven effective for generating code snippets, identifying and resolving complex software bugs is an inherently more challenging task. This blog post examines the effectiveness of two prominent LLMs—OpenAI's 4o-mini and Anthropic's Haiku—in catching hard-to-find bugs across software written in popular programming languages. By evaluating their performance, we aim to understand how reasoning models contribute to improving software verification processes.

## Results

In our study, we examined 210 instances of difficult software bugs to determine how effectively each model could identify them.

Overall:
- Anthropic's Haiku successfully identified 29 out of 210 bugs.
- OpenAI's 4o-mini identified 19 out of 210 bugs.

Across individual programming languages, the results reveal noteworthy variations:

1. **Go:**
   - Anthropic: Haiku: 6/42
   - OpenAI: 4o-mini: 3/42

2. **Python:**
   - Both Haiku and 4o-mini: 4/42

3. **TypeScript:**
   - Anthropic: Haiku: 6/42
   - OpenAI: 4o-mini: 2/42

4. **Rust:**
   - Anthropic: Haiku: 5/41
   - OpenAI: 4o-mini: 4/41

5. **Ruby:**
   - Anthropic: Haiku: 8/42
   - OpenAI: 4o-mini: 6/42

## Thoughts

The overall test results indicate that Anthropic's Haiku outperformed OpenAI's 4o-mini in detecting hard bugs across various programming languages. It's essential to note that language-specific performance gains are significant. For widely utilized languages like Python and TypeScript, 4o-mini struggled with competitive performance, showcasing comparable results only with Python where both models fared equally.

A plausible reason for these outcomes could be attributed to the depth of reasoning embedded within the Haiku model. While 4o-mini appears to depend more on pattern recognition derived from training data, Haiku's more extensive reasoning capabilities might enable it to navigate through non-obvious logical discrepancies which are harder to discern for ordinary models. This reasoning attribute becomes particularly advantageous in languages like Ruby and Go with less comprehensive training data available compared to Python and TypeScript.

## Interesting Bugs

Among the diverse challenges each model faced, Bug #49 in the Python category stood out:

- **Test Number 49:**
  - **Model Output (Haiku):** "The most critical bug in the code is that the `set` method in `FileSystemStorage` does not correctly handle the serialization of the `datetime` objects in cases where the value to be serialized contains them within a nested structure, leading to potential `TypeError` when attempting to write non-serializable datetime directly to a JSON file."
  - **OpenAI: 4o-mini Output:** Misdetected the bug.

Haiku's diagnostic approach exemplifies its robust error detection strategy, likely tapping into understanding how serialization mechanisms intertwine with Python's handling of date and time objects. In contrast, 4o-mini might have been hindered by focus areas less robustly trained on intricate Python-specific serialization errors.

This detailed examination reveals that reasoning-focused models like Haiku will continue playing critical roles in advancing the capabilities of AI-driven software verification tools. While LLMs hold great promise in revolutionizing code generation and debugging, the current landscape indicates that nuanced reasoning and comprehensive language model training underpin notable success in complex bug detection tasks.
