## Introduction

As the complexity of software systems continues to grow, finding effective ways to detect bugs within code becomes increasingly vital. The role of large language models (LLMs) is expanding in this domain, offering automated approaches to sift through lines of code to identify potential errors. Two LLM models, OpenAI's 4o-mini and Meta's Llama-3.3 70B, provide intriguing options for this task. Both are designed to enhance productivity, but how do their capabilities stack up against one another when it comes to detecting hard bugs in software programs? This post explores their strengths and weaknesses in this crucial area.

## Results

### General Performance

The analysis covered 210 bugs spread across various programming languages to evaluate both models' bug detection abilities. OpenAI's 4o-mini correctly identified 19 bugs, while Meta's Llama-3.3 70B identified 17 bugs. Such small numbers are not unexpected, given the complexity of the bugs involved. These results highlight the nascent stage of AI capabilities in software verification – yet, both models exhibit promising functionality as AI code reviewers.

### Language-by-Language Analysis

1. **Python**: In Python, the OpenAI 4o-mini managed to catch 4 out of 42 bugs, marginally outperforming Meta's Llama-3.3 70B, which caught 1 bug. This suggests that OpenAI's model might be more proficient at detecting typical issues in Python code.

2. **TypeScript**: For TypeScript, Meta's Llama-3.3 70B demonstrated its ability by catching 5 out of 42 bugs, whereas OpenAI's model only found 2. This could indicate Meta's model's stronger learning or pattern recognition capabilities within TypeScript environments.

3. **Go**: Both models performed equally well with Go, each detecting 3 out of 42 bugs. It reflects a somewhat neutral territory where neither model had a distinctive edge.

4. **Rust**: OpenAI narrowly edged out Meta with 4 detections compared to 3. This points to OpenAI's model perhaps having a slight advantage with the logic or patterns commonly used in Rust code.

5. **Ruby**: The differences were again marginal, with OpenAI catching 6 bugs compared to Meta's 5. This suggests both models possess relatively equal proficiency when deployed in Ruby environments.

## Thoughts

The variance in performance across languages may come from the training data and inherent design of each model. For instance, the dominance of Python in programming education and industry means there’s often more training data available, leading to some unexpected results where both models struggled equally. OpenAI's ability to better detect bugs in Rust and Ruby might result from a combination of its design philosophy and data exploration strategies embedded during model training.

Models perform better on widely used and familiar languages, likely due to larger datasets and clearer patterns for the non-thinking LLMs to leverage. Yet, interestingly, the planning/thinking models occasionally have an edge in less commonly used languages where logical reasoning can fill gaps left by sparser pattern data.

## Interesting Bugs

### Python Bug Analysis: Test Number 42

In Python, a particularly challenging bug was in test number 42, which dealt with a potential coding error regarding incorrect use of `.length` rather than the necessary `len()` method for determining the length of rows. Meta's Llama-3.3 70B failed to detect this error, while OpenAI's 4o-mini correctly identified it, suggesting that OpenAI’s pattern recognition was better attuned to this specific kind of Pythonic idiom error.

> - **Bug Caught:** True
> - **Bug Description:** "The most critical bug in the code is located in the `_load_csv_dataset` method where the incorrect usage of `.length` for `rows` should be replaced with `.len()` or `len(rows)` to obtain the number of rows, leading to an `AttributeError` when the code tries to access `rows.length`."

This insight into model performance shows OpenAI's edge in Python, a language with nuanced, idiomatic errors that can trip up even advanced models. It also underscores the necessity of a diverse and extensive training dataset to equip LLMs for such nuanced understanding.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, OpenAI: 4o-mini and Meta: Llama-3.3 70B each have their strengths across different programming languages. While results are mixed and no model consistently outperforms the other in all scenarios, both models offer significant promise in the field of automated bug detection. As model capabilities advance, they will undoubtedly become more adept at handling the complexities and subtleties of programming errors. Future iterations and improved datasets will be crucial in making these LMMs indispensable tools in a developer's toolkit.
