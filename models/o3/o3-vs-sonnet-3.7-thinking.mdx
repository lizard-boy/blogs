## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of software development, ensuring code quality and catching bugs early are central to maintaining robust applications. As language models (LLMs) have progressed, they’re increasingly being looked upon to aid in this aspect of software verification. This blog post delves into an in-depth comparison between two prominent LLMs: OpenAI: o3 and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking, analyzing their capabilities in catching hard-to-detect bugs across several programming languages. We ran tests to see how each model performs and whether a reasoning-based model like Anthropic's has an edge over OpenAI in specific contexts.

## Results

Our investigation benchmarked both models across five programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. Here are our test results:

**Overall Results:**

- **OpenAI: o3:** Out of the total bugs, it discovered a higher number of 38 out of 210 in multiple languages.
- **Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking:** This model found fewer bugs compared to OpenAI, only 21 out of 210 for most datasets.

**Language-Specific Results:**

- **Python:** Anthropic caught 2 bugs; OpenAI found 7.
- **TypeScript:** Both models performed similarly, with OpenAI finding 7, while Anthropic managed only 5.
- **Go:** The counts were closer; OpenAI found 7 bugs compared to Anthropic's 4.
- **Rust:** Here, OpenAI outperformed Anthropic, identifying 9 bugs vs. 5.
- **Ruby:** The difference was again notable, with OpenAI detecting 8 and Anthropic finding 5.

The results signify that the OpenAI: o3 model consistently outperformed the Anthropic model across all languages, pointing towards its general superiority in recognizing and addressing hard bugs.

## Thoughts

The disparity in performance between OpenAI: o3 and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking across most languages can primarily be attributed to training differences. OpenAI's extensive training on diverse patterns allows it to make efficient connections, thereby catching more bugs, possibly due to better pattern-matching capabilities. On the other hand, Anthropic's reasoning-based model, which includes an intentional thinking step, might have been expected to excel; however, it struggles, especially in languages with a well-defined coding pattern like Python and TypeScript.

The unique training routines and dataset exposure of these models also play a critical role. OpenAI's superior performance in Ruby and Rust could stem from a more tailored dataset training, allowing it to recognize the intrinsic patterns distinct to these languages, where other models might struggle due to less availability of these language-specific patterns in dataset training.

## Interesting Bugs

**Test Number: 42 - Python Dataset**

**OpenAI's Observation:** In the `_load_csv_dataset()` function, an incorrect method call `end_index = rows.length` instead of `len(rows)` was spotted, which raises an `AttributeError` and halts the CSV loading function.

**Anthropic's Observation:** Successfully identified a similar bug within the same function, pointing out the incorrect method call leading to an `AttributeError`.

Despite both models catching the particular bug, OpenAI's reasoning output was more frequent and broader in scope. Its superior handling in multiple complex scenarios suggests a more comprehensive training model, tuned better for the type of bug detection we performed.

The outcomes imply that OpenAI's architectural supremacy stems from its extensive training and optimization, yielding a robust model less dependent on reasoning steps, which have proven less critical in typical bug detection scenarios given current technological constraints and dataset preparation methodologies.

This observation asserts that for practical applications where instant bug detection and patching are required, OpenAI's approach offers a superior framework, paving the path towards automated code review and enhancement.
