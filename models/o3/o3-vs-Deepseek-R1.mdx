## Introduction

As the complexity of software systems increases, the ability to detect subtle yet critical bugs becomes crucial. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools in the landscape of software debugging. However, their efficacy in identifying hard-to-detect bugs is still under evaluation. In a recent series of tests, we compared two LLM models, OpenAI: o3 and DeepSeek: R1, focusing on their ability to uncover challenging bugs across various programming languages. This blog post delves into the comparative analysis of these models, aiming to understand their strengths and limitations.

## Results

In our tests, we evaluated 210 hard bugs across Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. OpenAI: o3 identified 38 bugs correctly, while DeepSeek: R1 identified 23 bugs. Our test results were as follows:

- **Python**: OpenAI: o3 caught 7 out of 42, while DeepSeek: R1 caught 3 out of 42.
- **TypeScript**: OpenAI: o3 caught 7 out of 42, surpassing DeepSeek: R1, which identified 6 out of 42.
- **Go**: OpenAI: o3 caught 7 out of 42. In contrast, DeepSeek: R1 managed only 3 out of 42.
- **Rust**: DeepSeek: R1 excelled, catching 7 out of 42, whereas OpenAI: o3 found 9 out of 42.
- **Ruby**: DeepSeek: R1 was notably better, with 4 out of 42 while OpenAI: o3 saw significantly fewer at 8 out of 42.

While OpenAI: o3 showed slight dominance in a few languages, DeepSeek: R1’s performance was generally stronger across others, particularly in lesser-used languages like Ruby, showcasing a potential advantage in logic-based error detection.

## Thoughts

The variance displayed in these results emphasizes the models’ strengths in different programming environments. OpenAI: o3’s training primarily on more widely-used languages like Python and TypeScript gives it a pattern recognition advantage. In contrast, DeepSeek: R1, with its reasoning capabilities, seemed to excel in detecting bugs in languages less frequently covered in mainstream training datasets.

OpenAI: o3, focusing heavily on pattern recognition, benefits environments where repetition and familiarity aid detection. However, it struggles in less common scenarios where logic-based internal consistency checks are crucial. DeepSeek: R1's planning step appears to allow deeper context analysis, enabling it to uncover issues in languages that may not follow the usual coding patterns found in larger data sets.

## Interesting Bugs

An illustrative bug involves a Ruby audio processing library where the TimeStretchProcessor class improperly calculated `normalize_gain`. Instead of adjusting the gain based on `stretch_factor`, a fixed formula was used, leading to incorrect audio levels. While OpenAI: o3 missed this issue, DeepSeek: R1 reasoned through it effectively.

**Test Number**: Python Bug - `42`

**DeepSeek: R1 Reasoning Output Quote**:
"In this bug, the calculate metrics calls math.log, but math is never imported at module scope. Therefore, any runtime use of CodeAnalyzer raises NameError: 'math' is not defined."

This reasoning showcases DeepSeek: R1’s aptitude in identifying dependencies and contextual inconsistencies, effectively tracing the logical chain required to foresee runtime implications.

By leveraging reasoning steps, DeepSeek: R1 shows potential for greater adaptability in dynamic investigation situations, capturing not just what matches a known pattern, but what deviates logically within a workflow, revealing bugs that stem from deeper logical misalignment.

Through this comparative analysis, DeepSeek: R1 demonstrated a nuanced understanding of logical flows, suggesting a promising avenue for complex bug resolution, especially in diverse coding environments where logic over pattern becomes crucial.
