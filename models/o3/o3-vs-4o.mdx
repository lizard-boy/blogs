title: OpenAI: o3 vs OpenAI: 4o - Evaluating Their Efficacy in Detecting Hard Bugs in Software
---

## Introduction

As artificial intelligence continues to permeate various sectors, one area where it holds particularly promising potential is in software development—specifically, in the domain of bug detection. While code generation has seen significant advancements, detecting hard bugs poses a distinct challenge. Recently, I put two language models, OpenAI: o3 and OpenAI: 4o, to the test, assessing their ability to identify complex bugs within software programs. This comparison aims to shed light on which model is better suited to assist developers in ensuring robust, error-free code.

## Results

In a comprehensive evaluation, I assessed the utility of OpenAI: o3 and OpenAI: 4o across a total of five programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. The performance was measured by the number of bugs detected from a set of pre-determined challenging bug scenarios.

- **Overall Results:** Of the total 210 bugs assessed, OpenAI: o3 emerged ahead with a detection count of 38, compared to OpenAI: 4o which detected 20 bugs. Although the numbers may appear modest, these bugs were deliberately chosen for their complexity.

- **Language-specific Performance:**
  - **Python:** OpenAI: o3 identified 7 bugs, compared to 6 by OpenAI: 4o.
  - **TypeScript:** OpenAI: o3 identified 7 bugs, compared to 4 by OpenAI: 4o.
  - **Go:** OpenAI: o3 identified 7 bugs, compared to 4 by OpenAI: 4o.
  - **Rust:** OpenAI: o3 identified 9 bugs, compared to 3 by OpenAI: 4o.
  - **Ruby:** OpenAI: o3 identified 8 bugs, compared to 3 by OpenAI: 4o.

## Thoughts

The varied performance across languages highlights an intriguing aspect of model capabilities. One hypothesis for the performance disparity, particularly in languages less dominated by conventional data sets like Ruby and Rust, is the ability of reasoning models like OpenAI: o3 to logically deduce issues rather than rely solely on pattern recognition. This aligns with the potential training data biases, where more extensively documented languages such as Python and TypeScript did not show significant discrepancies between the models.

The challenge of hard bugs requires reasoning beyond simple syntax or commonly seen patterns—something that reasoning models seem to excel at, as evidenced by their performance in Go, Rust, and Ruby.

## Interesting Bugs

One particularly fascinating scenario arose in Ruby:

- **Test number:** 1
- **Bug Description:** The TimeStretchProcessor class in a Ruby audio processing library had a bug in the way it calculated `normalize_gain`. Instead of adjusting based on the `stretch_factor`, which determines how much the audio will speed up or slow down, the code used a fixed formula. This resulted in incorrect audio amplitude after processing.

- **Reasoning Output for OpenAI: o3:** "The correct approach would be to scale the gain relative to the stretch to preserve consistent audio levels."

Despite the complexity of the audio processing logic, OpenAI: o3 was able to identify the flaw, showcasing not just its ability to find bugs but to contextually understand the logical errors within a domain-specific application. This kind of deep reasoning is precisely where models like OpenAI: o3 may offer more value over more traditional pattern-recognition models like OpenAI: 4o.

In conclusion, while both LLMs showed competency, OpenAI: o3's prowess in logical reasoning over pattern recognition holds the promise of better handling complex bugs, especially in less prevalent programming languages. As AI development proceeds, this aspect of logical deduction by reasoning models may become pivotal in reshaping how software development tackles errors and inefficiencies.
