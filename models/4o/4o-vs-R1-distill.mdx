## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of software development, the demand for efficient bug detection tools continues to grow. Traditional methods often require intensive manual reviews, leading to high costs and time consumption. However, recent advancements in machine learning, particularly with large language models (LLMs), offer promising alternatives. This article compares the bug detection capabilities of two prominent LLMs: OpenAI: 4o and DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama. We aim to understand which model is more adept at identifying complex bugs across different programming languages.

## Results

During our tests, we examined the performance of both models across five programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. Out of 50 complex software bugs, the detection results for the two models were as follows:

- **Overall:** OpenAI: 4o detected 20/210 bugs, while DeepSeek detected 37/210.
- **Python:** OpenAI: 4o detected 6/42 bugs, while DeepSeek detected 4/42.
- **TypeScript:** OpenAI: 4o detected 4/42 bugs, whereas DeepSeek detected 9/42.
- **Go:** OpenAI: 4o detected 4/42 bugs, compared to DeepSeek's 6/42.
- **Rust:** OpenAI: 4o detected 3/41 bugs, while DeepSeek caught 9/41.
- **Ruby:** OpenAI: 4o detected 3/42 bugs, while DeepSeek identified 9/42.

Overall, DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama displayed superior ability in detecting bugs, particularly in languages like TypeScript, Rust, and Ruby, where it significantly outperformed OpenAI: 4o.

## Thoughts

Our results indicate a clear differentiation between the two models' capabilities in bug detection. DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama's reasoning model seems to provide it with an edge in processing less common programming languages effectively, which may be due to its stronger logical deduction and inferencing skills. In contrast, OpenAI: 4o performed comparatively better in Python, likely due to its extensive training data in widely-used languages, allowing it to leverage pattern recognition in well-trodden code pathways.

The variance observed in performance across languages suggests that DeepSeek's logical structuring when reasoning about code execution is particularly beneficial for less prevalent languages, where historical data is sparse. As OpenAI relies more on broad data familiarity, its performance did not scale equally across all scenarios, highlighting the advantages of reasoning-enhanced LLMs in niche areas.

## Interesting Bugs

One interesting bug was detected by DeepSeek: R1 Distill Llama but missed by OpenAI: 4o in Python, test number 21. Here's the reasoning provided by DeepSeek:

> "**The most critical bug in the code is the use of asynchronous functions (e.g., `async def ...`) within the `ModelMonitor` and `ModelRetrainer` classes without an actual asynchronous event loop being managed; these functions are called using `asyncio.run()` within threads, leading to potential runtime errors and incorrect execution, making it critical to establish the correct asynchronous context.**"

This suggests that DeepSeek understood the intricacy of managing asynchronous tasks within a threaded environment, recognizing potential pitfalls associated with `asyncio.run()` within threads. OpenAI's failure to detect this bug indicates a gap in its ability to recognize the nuances of async operations intertwined with thread management. Understanding this difference underscores the importance of training LLMs to parse and interpret asynchronous logic uniquely, especially in environments where concurrency introduces complexity.

With continuous advancements in LLMs, exploring and understanding these distinctions can lead to more effective applications in software development practices, ultimately improving efficiency and reliability in bug detection and software verification.
