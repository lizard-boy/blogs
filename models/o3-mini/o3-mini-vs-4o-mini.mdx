OpenAI has been shipping increasingly capable small models lately â€” and two of its most interesting contenders for AI code review are **o3-mini** and **4o-mini**. Both are designed for lightweight reasoning tasks, but which one is better at finding *real bugs* in software?

We tested them head-to-head across five programming languages to find out.

## ðŸ§ª How We Tested

Our benchmark dataset consists of 210 programs, each seeded with a realistic bug. These arenâ€™t easy-to-spot errors â€” theyâ€™re subtle logic flaws, concurrency issues, or semantic edge cases that might slip past linters, tests, and even human reviewers.

The languages we evaluated: Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Ruby. Both models were given the same prompt and context and asked to flag any bugs.

</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## ðŸ“Š Results

**Overall Performance**  
- **o3-mini**: Caught 37 bugs  
- **4o-mini**: Caught 19 bugs

Thatâ€™s nearly 2Ã— better performance from o3-mini.

**By Language**  
- **Python**: o3-mini found 7, 4o-mini found 4  
- **TypeScript**: o3-mini found 7, 4o-mini found 2  
- **Go**: o3-mini found 7, 4o-mini found 3  
- **Rust**: o3-mini found 9, 4o-mini found 4  
- **Ruby**: o3-mini found 7, 4o-mini found 6

The gap is consistent across all languages, though it's slightly narrower in Ruby.

## ðŸ§  Why the Gap?

There are a few plausible reasons o3-mini consistently outperformed 4o-mini:

- **Planning and Reasoning**: o3-mini appears to be part of OpenAIâ€™s reasoning-first model family, where generation is preceded by internal planning. That extra step often helps catch bugs that arenâ€™t obvious pattern matches.

- **Model Architecture**: Itâ€™s possible that o3-mini benefits from architectural tweaks or system-level optimizations that give it better performance in logic-heavy tasks like bug detection.

- **Training Differences**: Both models were likely trained on overlapping data, but o3-mini might have had more targeted training around software-related reasoning or verification patterns.

In contrast, 4o-mini, while fast and compact, may sacrifice some of that depth for speed or generality.

## ðŸ§© Bug Highlight: Python Logic Collapse

Hereâ€™s one bug that illustrates the difference in depth between the models.

**Test 50: Search Endpoint Filter Collapse**

In a Python script handling task search filters, there were two `$or` keys in the query dictionary. The second one overwrote the first, breaking the compound filtering logic.

- **o3-mini's Output**:  
  > "The function relies on having multiple `$or` conditions in the query dict, but the second overwrites the first. This results in user-based filtering being completely ignored, breaking the intended search behavior."

- **4o-mini's Output**:  
  > "The `$or` logic may not work as intended because the dictionary has duplicate keys."

Both models identified the general issue â€” but o3-mini offered a much clearer understanding of the logical consequence. It didnâ€™t just spot the key conflict; it explained why it *matters*.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

In this benchmark, **o3-mini was the clear winner**. It found more bugs, gave better explanations, and performed more consistently across all five languages.

4o-mini still shows potential, especially in more surface-level issues or languages with high training coverage. But if your use case demands catching hard bugs â€” particularly the kind that sneak past pattern-matching â€” o3-mini is the better choice today.
