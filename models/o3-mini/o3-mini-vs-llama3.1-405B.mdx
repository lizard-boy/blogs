Bug detection is a fundamentally harder problem than code generation. It requires a model to understand logic, spot inconsistencies, and reason through how a program *should* behave â€” not just how code is typically written.

With reasoning-first models gaining traction, we decided to benchmark two of the most capable: **OpenAIâ€™s o3-mini** and **Metaâ€™s Llama-3.1 405B**. Both models claim strong reasoning ability, so we tested them on a dataset of deliberately hard-to-catch bugs across multiple languages.

## ðŸ§ª Test Setup

We compiled a set of 210 real-world-inspired programs, each with a single, tricky bug manually introduced. These bugs were designed to:

1. Be subtle enough to evade linters, unit tests, and manual review.
2. Still be realistic â€” things a professional developer might accidentally write.

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## ðŸ“Š Results

- **OpenAI o3-mini**: Caught 37 bugs out of 210.
- **Meta Llama-3.1 405B**: Caught 24 bugs.

Given the difficulty of the bugs, those numbers are actually quite promising â€” and tell us a lot about model behavior under stress.

### Language-Level Breakdown:

- **Go**: o3-mini caught 7 bugs, Llama caught 5.
- **Python**: o3-mini caught 7, Llama caught 5.
- **TypeScript**: Llama edged ahead with 8 vs. o3-miniâ€™s 7.
- **Rust**: o3-mini crushed this one â€” 9 bugs caught vs. Llamaâ€™s 1.
- **Ruby**: A tighter race â€” 7 for o3-mini, 5 for Llama.

The performance gap is widest in **Rust**, where Llama underperformed significantly.

## ðŸ§  Interpretation

Why the difference? A few theories:

1. **Training data bias**: Both models likely saw more Python and TypeScript in pretraining, so theyâ€™re better at catching issues in those languages. This levels the playing field for high-coverage languages.
2. **Reasoning over pattern-matching**: For lower-coverage languages like Rust and Ruby, pattern-matching fails â€” and models have to think. Thatâ€™s where o3-miniâ€™s structured reasoning helps it stand out.
3. **Concurrency and logic errors**: o3-mini seems more reliable in scenarios where logic, order of operations, or implicit state matter â€” the kinds of bugs that go beyond syntax and into behavior.

## ðŸ§© A Bug Worth Highlighting

Hereâ€™s a standout example â€” test #2 in Go: a **race condition in a smart home notification system**.

The bug lived in the `NotifyDeviceUpdate` method, which lacked proper synchronization before broadcasting device state. This could result in stale or partially updated device data being sent to clients.

**Only o3-mini caught it.** Llama missed it entirely.

That kind of bug is incredibly hard to spot unless the model understands **temporal relationships** and **shared state** â€” not just surface-level syntax. o3-miniâ€™s ability to reason through concurrency is why it flagged it.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

OpenAI o3-mini consistently outperformed Metaâ€™s Llama-3.1 405B across the board, especially in less popular languages and bugs requiring deeper logical reasoning. That said, Llama still performed respectably in high-coverage languages like TypeScript and Python â€” and itâ€™s possible that with further fine-tuning, these gaps could close.

But today, if youâ€™re building or relying on AI for serious **bug detection** or **AI code review**, the evidence points to o3-mini being the stronger tool.
