AI models are rapidly improving at generating code — but detecting real bugs is a different game entirely. It requires reasoning, understanding intent, and identifying subtle mismatches between what code does and what it's supposed to do.

In this post, we compare two strong contenders for AI code review: **OpenAI’s o3-mini** and **DeepSeek v3**. Both are compact, efficient, and capable — but which one is better at catching **hard bugs**?

## 🧪 Evaluation Setup

We ran both models on a dataset of **210 small programs**, each with one subtle, logic-breaking bug.

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

Here are the programs we created for the evaluation:

		borderCollapse: 'collapse',
		width: '100%',
		margin: '2rem 0',
		borderRadius: '8px',
		overflow: 'hidden',
		fontSize: '0.95rem',
		lineHeight: '1.5'
	}}>
	<thead>

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td
					style={{
						padding: '1rem',
						borderBottom: '1px solid var(--tw-prose-border, #e2e8f0)',

					}}>
					{row[0]}
				</td>
				<td
					style={{

					}}>
					{row[1]}
				</td>
			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \response\ variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## 📊 Results

**Overall Bug Detection**
- **OpenAI o3-mini**: 37 bugs  
- **DeepSeek v3**: 27 bugs  

**By Language**
- **Go**: o3-mini found 7, DeepSeek found 5  
- **Python**: o3-mini found 7, DeepSeek found 8  
- **TypeScript**: o3-mini found 7, DeepSeek found 4  
- **Rust**: o3-mini found 9, DeepSeek found 5  
- **Ruby**: o3-mini found 7, DeepSeek found 5

OpenAI o3-mini consistently outperformed DeepSeek in four of five languages. DeepSeek’s only win was in Python, where it found one more bug than o3-mini.

## 🧠 Thoughts

Despite DeepSeek v3’s strong reasoning capabilities, **OpenAI o3-mini was the stronger model overall** — both in total bugs caught and language-level consistency.

o3-mini’s edge likely comes from a combination of:
- **Better pattern recognition** in high-coverage languages like TypeScript and Rust
- **Structured internal reasoning**, even if it doesn’t explicitly present itself as a “thinking” model

DeepSeek v3, meanwhile, showed strength in logic-heavy domains like Python and Ruby — particularly where bugs required tracking variable flow or async behavior.

This fits a familiar pattern:  
- **o3-mini** thrives where training data is rich and the bugs resemble known patterns  
- **DeepSeek** closes the gap when deduction is needed over memorization

## 🧩 A Bug Worth Highlighting

Here’s an example showing how **o3-mini outperformed DeepSeek** — Program 33, a bug in a Ruby audio processing library:

In the TimeStretchProcessor class, the normalize_gain value was calculated using a **fixed formula**, instead of scaling based on the stretch_factor. This led to inconsistent audio levels depending on how much the sample was sped up or slowed down.

- **o3-mini** flagged the issue:  
  > "Instead of adjusting the gain based on the stretch_factor—which represents how much the audio is being sped up or slowed down—it uses a fixed formula."

- **DeepSeek v3** missed it entirely.

This was a logic bug that couldn’t be caught by just scanning syntax or common patterns — o3-mini had to understand the **intent** of the time-stretching operation and why constant gain would break audio normalization.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

**OpenAI o3-mini** is the better overall model for AI-powered bug detection today. It’s more consistent, catches more bugs across more languages, and blends reasoning with strong pattern coverage.

**DeepSeek v3**, however, isn’t far behind. It shines in logic-heavy cases, and its reasoning ability gives it an edge in languages where pattern data is sparse or the bug requires tracing consequences beyond the current function.

For engineering teams exploring AI code review:
- Choose **o3-mini** for breadth and consistency
- Consider **DeepSeek v3** for logic-first or lower-resource language environments
