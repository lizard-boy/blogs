As AI code review tools become more widely adopted, a key question remains: how well can they catch **real bugs** â€” not just generate code, but spot logic flaws, edge cases, and race conditions?

In this post, we compare **OpenAIâ€™s o3-mini** and **Anthropicâ€™s Sonnet 3.7**, two compact but capable models. Both were tested head-to-head on a benchmark of hard-to-catch bugs spanning Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby.


## ðŸ§ª The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

Here are the programs we created for the evaluation:

<table
	style={{
		borderCollapse: 'collapse',
		width: '100%',
		margin: '2rem 0',
		borderRadius: '8px',
		overflow: 'hidden',
		fontSize: '0.95rem',
		lineHeight: '1.5'
	}}>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th

				}}>
				ID
			</th>
			<th

				}}></th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td
					style={{
						padding: '1rem',
						borderBottom: '1px solid var(--tw-prose-border, #e2e8f0)',

					}}>
					{row[0]}
				</td>
				<td
					style={{

					}}>
					{row[1]}
				</td>
			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \response\ variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## ðŸ“Š Results

**Overall Bug Detection**
- **OpenAI o3-mini**: 37 bugs  
- **Anthropic Sonnet 3.7**: 32 bugs

While the total gap is modest, the language-level breakdown shows more nuance.

**By Language**
- **Python**: o3-mini found 7, Sonnet 3.7 found 4  
- **TypeScript**: o3-mini found 7, Sonnet 3.7 found 9  
- **Go**: o3-mini found 7, Sonnet 3.7 found 6  
- **Rust**: o3-mini found 9, Sonnet 3.7 found 6  
- **Ruby**: Both models tied at 7

The two models are competitive. o3-mini leads slightly in Python and Rust. Sonnet 3.7 holds its own in TypeScript and Go, with Ruby coming out even.

## ðŸ§  Thoughts

Despite similar totals, **OpenAI o3-mini outperformed Sonnet 3.7** overall â€” and was more consistent across all five languages.

That said, **Sonnet 3.7 showed signs of stronger reasoning** in specific edge cases, especially when dealing with concurrency and async behavior. Its performance in TypeScript â€” and competitive showing in Go â€” suggest that while it may not match o3-miniâ€™s overall pattern recognition, it closes the gap through deeper logic handling.

This matches what weâ€™ve seen in other benchmarks:  
- **o3-mini** shines in common languages with high training data coverage.  
- **Sonnet 3.7** shows promise in languages and bug types where reasoning trumps memorization.

Thereâ€™s no universal winner â€” just strengths that shift based on language, bug type, and model architecture.

## ðŸ§© A Bug Worth Highlighting

**Go â€” Smart Home Race Condition**

This bug appeared in a smart home notification system. A NotifyDeviceUpdate method broadcasted state changes â€” but failed to lock shared state first, creating a race condition.

- **Sonnet 3.7 caught it**  
- **o3-mini missed it**

> *"The most critical bug is that there was no locking around device updates before broadcasting, which could lead to race conditions where clients receive stale or partially updated device state."*

Sonnetâ€™s output showed clear reasoning about concurrent access and mutation. It understood not just what the code did, but **what could go wrong** â€” and why that matters. This is the kind of logic bug that trips up models without reasoning steps.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

Both o3-mini and Sonnet 3.7 are capable bug detectors.  
- **o3-mini** performs better overall, especially in Python and Rust.  
- **Sonnet 3.7** holds its own â€” and even outperforms in select cases â€” especially where bugs involve async logic or less-common control flow.

If youâ€™re looking for the best **all-around model today for AI code review**, o3-mini is likely your top pick. But for teams tackling edge cases, concurrency, or lower-resource languages, **Sonnet 3.7 brings unique value through deeper logic reasoning.**
