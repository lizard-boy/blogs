AI code review tools are getting smarter â€” but how good are they at finding real bugs? Not toy examples, but subtle, logic-breaking issues that would stump even seasoned developers?

To answer that, we ran a benchmark comparing **OpenAIâ€™s o3-mini** against **Metaâ€™s Llama-3.3 70B**, two of the strongest reasoning-focused LLMs available today. The goal: see how well they perform on real-world bug detection across multiple programming languages.

## ðŸ§ª How We Tested

We built a dataset of 210 small programs, each seeded with a subtle, realistic bug. These werenâ€™t typo-level issues â€” they were logic flaws, race conditions, or edge case failures that a senior engineer might accidentally miss. Each bug was manually crafted, with careful attention to staying plausible.

Languages tested: Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, and Ruby.

We then asked each model to review the files and identify bugs. No fine-tuning, no fancy prompt chains â€” just a simple evaluation of what they can do out of the box.

</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## ðŸ“Š Results

**Overall Performance**:  
- OpenAI o3-mini caught **37** bugs.  
- Meta Llama-3.3 70B caught **17**.

**Language-by-language breakdown**:  
- **Go**: o3-mini found 7, Llama found 3.  
- **Python**: o3-mini found 7, Llama found 1.  
- **TypeScript**: o3-mini found 7, Llama found 5.  
- **Rust**: o3-mini found 9, Llama found 3.  
- **Ruby**: o3-mini found 7, Llama found 5.

Across every language, o3-mini outperformed Llama-3.3 â€” sometimes by a large margin.

## ðŸ§  Why the Gap?

There are a few factors likely at play:

1. **Training distribution**: o3-mini might have more targeted exposure to Python, Rust, and lower-level concurrency patterns. Its consistent strength across all languages, especially Rust, suggests deeper familiarity with systems-level bugs.

2. **Reasoning capability**: Despite being smaller, o3-mini benefits from OpenAIâ€™s thinking-style model architecture. It tends to reason more clearly about program behavior, especially in async or multithreaded environments.

3. **Scale â‰  Accuracy**: Even though Llama-3.3 is a 70B parameter model, its raw size doesnâ€™t guarantee better performance for tasks that require nuanced logic. For bug detection, thoughtful reasoning often beats raw token prediction.

## ðŸ§© A Bug Worth Highlighting

In one Python test case, both models were asked to analyze a path reconstruction function that used a shared dictionary (`came_from`) inside a loop. The bug involved concurrency: if the dictionary was modified during execution, it could lead to corrupted paths.

- **OpenAI o3-mini**:  
  > "The most critical bug is that the function relies directly on the mutable `came_from` dictionary in the loop without snapshotting or locking it, exposing the code to asynchronous modifications that can alter path reconstruction mid-execution."

- **Meta Llama-3.3**:  
  > "The most critical bug in this code is that it does not handle the case where the `came_from` dictionary is modified concurrently during the execution of the `reconstruction_path` method, potentially leading to inconsistent or incorrect path reconstruction."

Both got it. But o3-mini's explanation was more precise â€” identifying both *when* the bug happens and *why* itâ€™s dangerous. It showed an understanding of threading hazards and proper mitigation strategies.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

OpenAI o3-mini clearly outperforms Metaâ€™s Llama-3.3 70B when it comes to identifying subtle software bugs â€” across all five languages we tested. While Llama-3.3 is no slouch, its accuracy dropped significantly in areas where pattern-matching wasn't enough and reasoning was essential.

For teams evaluating AI models for **AI code review**, **automated bug detection**, or **LLM-driven static analysis**, o3-mini is the stronger choice today.
