Bug detection is one of the hardest tasks in software engineering ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just as challenging for AI models. Unlike code generation, which often relies on pattern completion, bug detection requires inference, planning, and the ability to reason through edge cases and hidden logic.

In this post, we compare **OpenAI‚Äôs o3-mini** and **Anthropic‚Äôs Sonnet 3.7 Thinking**, two compact models that bring very different architectures to the table. The former is a reasoning-first OpenAI model. The latter, an explicitly ‚Äúthinking‚Äù variant from Anthropic, adds a planning step before response generation. Which one catches more bugs?

## üß™ Evaluation Setup

We tested both models on a benchmark of 210 small programs, each with one subtle bug ‚Äî typically a logic error, a concurrency edge case, or an intentionally tricky misuse of a common API.

Languages tested: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby.

Each model got the same prompt, context, and structure.

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## üìä Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **OpenAI o3-mini**: 37  
- **Anthropic Sonnet 3.7 Thinking**: 21

**By Language**
- **Python**: o3-mini 7, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking 2  
- **TypeScript**: o3-mini 7, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking 5  
- **Rust**: o3-mini 9, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking 5  
- **Ruby**: o3-mini 7, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking 5  
- **Go**: o3-mini 7, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking 4

OpenAI‚Äôs o3-mini outperformed Sonnet 3.7 Thinking across the board ‚Äî especially in Python and Rust. Sonnet was more competitive in Ruby and TypeScript, and showed reasonable generalization in Go.

## üß† Thoughts

Despite being a ‚Äúthinking‚Äù model, **Anthropic‚Äôs Sonnet 3.7 Thinking did not outperform OpenAI‚Äôs o3-mini** in overall bug detection.

o3-mini demonstrated stronger consistency across languages ‚Äî and particularly dominated in Python and Rust, likely due to a combination of:
- **Pattern recognition**, thanks to extensive training on code
- **Internal planning**, which o3-mini appears to do even without an explicit ‚Äúthinking step‚Äù

Sonnet 3.7 Thinking did show sparks of reasoning strength in some lower-resource languages like Ruby and Go, where logic deduction plays a bigger role and memorization falls short. But it didn‚Äôt close the gap overall.

It‚Äôs possible that Sonnet‚Äôs thinking step helps **in theory**, but doesn‚Äôt yet translate into **better bug detection performance** ‚Äî at least on this dataset.

## üîç Where Reasoning Helped

One case showed Sonnet 3.7 Thinking‚Äôs strengths:

**Test Case #2 ‚Äî Python: Asynchronous Path Bug**

This involved a path reconstruction function that relied on a shared dictionary (`came_from`) across asynchronous contexts. A race condition could corrupt the logic mid-execution.

- **Sonnet 3.7 Thinking‚Äôs Output**:  
  > "The most critical bug is that the function does not protect against asynchronous modifications to the `came_from` dictionary during path reconstruction, potentially leading to inconsistent paths or infinite loops."

- **o3-mini** missed the issue.

This is where reasoning helps. Sonnet correctly inferred future states, race conditions, and the consequences of mutation ‚Äî without obvious syntactic cues. It‚Äôs a good sign for future ‚Äúthinking‚Äù model generations.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

**OpenAI o3-mini outperformed Sonnet 3.7 Thinking** in this benchmark ‚Äî both in overall accuracy and consistency across languages.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean reasoning models aren‚Äôt useful. When bugs require following multiple steps of logic or simulating asynchronous behavior, Sonnet 3.7 Thinking has real value ‚Äî just not enough (yet) to win outright.

If you‚Äôre building AI-powered code review today, **o3-mini is the stronger choice** for detecting logic and concurrency bugs across
