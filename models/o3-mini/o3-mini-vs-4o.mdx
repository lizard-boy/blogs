Large language models are getting better at generating code â€” but can they *debug* it?

In this post, we compare two of OpenAIâ€™s best small models â€” **o3-mini** and **4o** â€” to see how well they perform at detecting subtle bugs in real-world software. Both models are capable, but they take different approaches under the hood: o3-mini is designed for structured reasoning, while 4o is optimized for speed and performance across a wide range of tasks.

## ðŸ§ª Benchmark Setup

We built a benchmark of 210 small programs, each seeded with a real, hard-to-spot bug. These werenâ€™t toy problems â€” they were realistic logic errors, edge cases, and misuses of APIs that could easily slip through linters, tests, and even manual review.

We wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## ðŸ“Š Results

**Total Bugs Detected**  
- **OpenAI o3-mini**: 37  
- **OpenAI 4o**: 20

**Breakdown by Language**  
- **Python**: o3-mini found 7, 4o found 6  
- **TypeScript**: o3-mini found 7, 4o found 4  
- **Go**: o3-mini found 7, 4o found 4  
- **Rust**: o3-mini found 9, 4o found 3  
- **Ruby**: o3-mini found 7, 4o found 3

The gap is especially wide in Rust and Ruby â€” languages with less LLM training coverage, where pattern matching often falls short.

## ðŸ§  Observations

The data points to a clear trend: **o3-mini outperforms 4o across the board**, and the difference grows in languages with lower training representation. This is likely due to the architectural difference between the models.

- **o3-mini** is part of OpenAIâ€™s reasoning-first model family â€” it takes a planning step before generating its response. This gives it a leg up in situations where logic, structure, or intent need to be inferred â€” like in bug detection.
  
- **4o**, while powerful, seems more tuned for broad task coverage and performance speed. Its bug detection suffers slightly in areas that require deep structural understanding.

In high-resource languages like Python and Go, where thereâ€™s ample training data, 4o performs respectably. But in domains like Rust and Ruby, o3-miniâ€™s reasoning ability shines through.

## ðŸ§© Example: Ruby Audio Bug

One standout case involved a Ruby audio processing library. In the `TimeStretchProcessor` class, the bug was in the `normalize_gain` calculation â€” it used a fixed value instead of scaling based on the `stretch_factor`, resulting in audio with inconsistent amplitude.

- **o3-mini** caught the issue immediately. It explained that the gain logic didnâ€™t respect time-stretching parameters, leading to mismatched output.

- **4o** missed it entirely.

This was a logic error embedded in a domain-specific pattern â€” not a syntax problem. Itâ€™s exactly the kind of bug where reasoning models provide real value.

## âœ… Conclusion

Both o3-mini and 4o are capable models â€” but when it comes to **AI code review** and **bug detection**, o3-mini has a clear edge. Its structured reasoning lets it catch more complex bugs, especially in languages where data is sparse and logic matters more than patterns.

For engineering teams relying on LLMs to improve code quality, o3-mini is the safer bet â€” especially for logic-heavy or backend-heavy stacks.
