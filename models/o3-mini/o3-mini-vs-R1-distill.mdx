Bug detection is one of the hardest applications for LLMs. It requires logic, understanding, and often some imagination â€” not just pattern recognition. In this post, we compare two capable models in this space: **OpenAIâ€™s o3-mini** and **DeepSeekâ€™s R1 Distill Llama**, both tested on the same dataset of subtle, realistic bugs.

The goal? See which model performs better across a variety of programming languages, and more importantly, where and why they succeed or fail.

## ðŸ§ª How We Tested

We evaluated both models on 210 hand-crafted programs, each containing a subtle but realistic bug. These bugs are hard by design â€” the kind that get through CI, sneak past linters, and still end up in production.

We wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

Here are the programs we created for the evaluation:

			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \response\ variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## ðŸ“Š Results

Hereâ€™s how the two models performed across languages:

- **Go**:  
  - DeepSeek: 6 bugs  
  - o3-mini: 7 bugs

- **Python**:  
  - DeepSeek: 4 bugs  
  - o3-mini: 7 bugs

- **TypeScript**:  
  - DeepSeek: 9 bugs  
  - o3-mini: 7 bugs

- **Rust**:  
  - DeepSeek: 9 bugs  
  - o3-mini: 9 bugs

- **Ruby**:  
  - DeepSeek: 9 bugs  
  - o3-mini: 7 bugs

**Overall**, both models discovered **37 bugs** out of 210. Itâ€™s a tie â€” but not an even one.

While the total number is the same, the **distribution** tells a deeper story. DeepSeek excelled in Ruby and TypeScript. OpenAI o3-mini dominated in Python and Go. Rust was the one language where both models held their own.

## ðŸ§  Takeaways

The results show that bug detection isnâ€™t a uniform task â€” different languages stress different parts of a modelâ€™s capabilities.

- **o3-mini** appears to benefit from strong training coverage in high-frequency languages like Python and Go. Itâ€™s likely better at pattern recognition and spotting idiomatic bugs that are common in production code.
  
- **DeepSeek**, on the other hand, stands out in Ruby and TypeScript â€” languages that may have spottier training coverage. Its performance suggests strong reasoning and generalization ability, especially where pattern-based learning starts to break down.

This diversity in performance highlights the need for adaptive AI code review â€” the best model might depend on your stack.

## ðŸ§© A Bug Worth Highlighting

One of the more surprising moments came in **Test #2**, from a Go smart home system.

The bug involved a **race condition** in the NotifyDeviceUpdate method â€” state was being modified and broadcasted without synchronization. Classic concurrency hazard.

- **DeepSeek caught it.**  
- **o3-mini missed it.**

DeepSeekâ€™s output:  
> "There is no locking around device updates before broadcasting, which could lead to race conditions where clients receive stale or partially updated device state."

This is exactly the kind of issue that benefits from **reasoning** over memorization. DeepSeek inferred not just what the code was doing, but what could go wrong â€” and why.

## âœ… Final Thoughts

Both models are strong. But theyâ€™re strong in **different ways**:

- **OpenAI o3-mini** excels where training coverage and pattern recognition are enough â€” especially in Python and Go.
- **DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama** thrives in cases that require general reasoning and inference â€” especially in Ruby, TypeScript, and concurrency-heavy logic.

If you're building AI-powered code review, your choice of model might depend on your stack â€” and the kinds of bugs you're most worried about.
