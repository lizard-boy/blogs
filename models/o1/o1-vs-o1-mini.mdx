AI models are increasingly used to generate code—but how well do they **review** it?

Bug detection is fundamentally different from code generation. It requires reasoning, logic tracing, and the ability to catch subtle issues that don’t follow known patterns. In this post, we compare **OpenAI’s o1** and **o1-mini** models on their ability to detect real-world software bugs across five programming languages.


## 🧪 The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

<table

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{

		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## 📊 Results

**Total Bugs Detected**
- **OpenAI o1**: 15  
- **OpenAI o1-mini**: 11

### Detection by Language

- **Go**:  
  - Both models: 2/42  

- **Python**:  
  - Both models: 2/42  

- **TypeScript**:  
  - o1: 4  
  - o1-mini: 1  

- **Rust**:  
  - o1: 3  
  - o1-mini: 2  

- **Ruby**:  
  - Both models: 4  

While both models struggled across the board, **o1 consistently outperformed o1-mini**, especially in **TypeScript** and **Rust**. In Ruby and Python, they performed similarly.

## 💡 Analysis

Despite being the smaller, lighter-weight option, **o1-mini did not demonstrate stronger reasoning capabilities** in this benchmark. In fact, **OpenAI o1 was slightly better overall**, especially in languages with richer structural diversity like TypeScript.

This could suggest that:
- o1 has broader pattern exposure from training data, enabling better detection even in non-reasoning tasks.
- o1-mini may prioritize speed and simplicity over depth, making it less equipped to trace multi-step logic or concurrency issues.

Interestingly, **both models struggled equally in Python and Go**, despite these being among the most popular languages—indicating that real-world bugs can’t always be solved through memorized patterns alone.

## 🐞 A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test #2 — Python: Concurrency in Pathfinding

A concurrency issue emerged in a Python pathfinding implementation. A shared `came_from` dictionary could be modified asynchronously during the `reconstruction_path` method.

- **o1 caught the bug**  
- **o1-mini missed it**

**o1’s output**:
> "The method does not create an immutable snapshot of `came_from`, allowing concurrent modifications that can lead to inconsistent path reconstruction or runtime errors during the loop."

Spotting this required **reasoning about mutation, timing, and control flow**—something o1 handled but o1-mini missed. This highlights the importance of deeper logic tracing, especially for race conditions and shared state management.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

While both models are limited in their current bug detection capabilities, **OpenAI o1 consistently outperforms o1-mini**, especially in languages that demand more semantic structure or deeper reasoning.

- Use **o1** for better bug detection accuracy, especially if you're reviewing TypeScript or Rust.
- Use **o1-mini** for lighter tasks or where compute efficiency matters more than precision.
