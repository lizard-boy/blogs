LLMs are often used to **generate** code—but what happens when you ask them to **review** it?

Bug detection requires more than syntax awareness. It demands logic, reasoning, and the ability to identify what’s _missing_ in a block of code. In this benchmark, we tested two prominent models—**OpenAI o1** and **Meta Llama-3.3 70B**—on their ability to detect subtle bugs in real-world programs.


## 🧪 The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## 📊 Results

**Total Bugs Detected**
- **Meta Llama-3.3 70B**: 27  
- **OpenAI o1**: 15

### Detection Breakdown by Language

- **Python**:  
  - o1: 2  
  - Llama-3.3 70B: 1  

- **TypeScript**:  
  - o1: 4  
  - Llama-3.3 70B: 5  

- **Go**:  
  - o1: 2  
  - Llama-3.3 70B: 3  

- **Rust**:  
  - Both: 3  

- **Ruby**:  
  - o1: 4  
  - Llama-3.3 70B: 5  

While OpenAI o1 slightly outperformed in Python, **Meta Llama-3.3 70B outscored o1 overall**, with consistent improvements in TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.

## 💡 Interpretation

The modest edge for Meta’s Llama-3.3 70B seems to stem from its **reasoning capabilities**. Pattern-based models like OpenAI o1 often succeed in high-data languages like Python, where bug structures are common and recognizable. But when deeper logic is required—especially for bugs that involve **concurrency**, **shared state**, or **multi-step inference**—Llama-3.3 70B tends to do better.

Both models struggled in Rust, highlighting how difficult low-level correctness remains for general-purpose LLMs.

## 🐞 A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test #2 — Python: Concurrency Edge Case

A bug in a pathfinding implementation involved a shared `came_from` dictionary being mutated asynchronously during the execution of `reconstruction_path()`—causing potential corruption of the path output.

- **Meta Llama-3.3 70B caught the bug**  
- **OpenAI o1 missed it**

**Llama’s output**:
> "The code does not handle the case where `came_from` is modified concurrently during the reconstruction process, which can lead to inconsistent or incorrect path results."

This is the kind of issue that requires **predicting asynchronous side effects**—not something that shows up with surface-level pattern matching.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

Both OpenAI o1 and Meta Llama-3.3 70B show promising bug detection ability. But when subtle logic or concurrency is involved, **Llama-3.3 70B’s reasoning edge becomes clear**.

- Choose **Meta Llama-3.3 70B** if your bug detection needs span multiple languages or complex logic.
- Choose **OpenAI o1** for simpler tasks or lightweight review use cases where speed and efficiency are key.
