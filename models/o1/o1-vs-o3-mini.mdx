As AI continues to expand its reach in software engineering, a key frontier is bug detection. Generating code is one thing—but **catching real-world bugs** requires deeper reasoning, context awareness, and logic tracing.

This post compares two models from OpenAI: the lightweight **o1**, and the reasoning-enhanced **o3-mini**, to see how well they detect complex bugs in real codebases.

## 🧪 The Evaluation Setup

We designed a benchmark of **210 buggy programs**, drawn from 16 real-world domains. Each program contained one subtle, realistic bug. Languages tested:

- Python  
- TypeScript  
- Go  
- Rust  
- Ruby  


## 🧪 The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>

					}}>
					{row[1]}
				</td>
			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## 📊 Results

**Total Bugs Caught**
- **OpenAI o3-mini**: 37  
- **OpenAI o1**: 15  

### Detection by Language

- **Python**:  
  - o1: 2  
  - o3-mini: 7  

- **TypeScript**:  
  - o1: 4  
  - o3-mini: 7  

- **Go**:  
  - o1: 2  
  - o3-mini: 7  

- **Rust**:  
  - o1: 3  
  - o3-mini: 9  

- **Ruby**:  
  - o1: 4  
  - o3-mini: 7  

Across all five languages, o3-mini outperformed o1—sometimes by a wide margin.

## 💡 Why o3-mini Wins

The key difference? **Reasoning**.

- **o3-mini** includes a structured planning step before generating responses. This helps it trace logic, evaluate intent, and surface bugs that go beyond syntax or pattern matching.
- **o1**, while capable, relies more heavily on memorized patterns. It performs adequately in languages like TypeScript or Python where pattern-based bugs are common, but struggles when logical deduction is required.

The gap widens in languages like Rust and Ruby, where o3-mini’s structured reasoning helps it generalize even with sparse training data.

## 🐞 A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test #42 — Python: AttributeError in CSV Handling

In this test, a function tried to determine the number of CSV rows using `rows.length` instead of Python’s correct `len(rows)`—a subtle but critical mistake.

- **o3-mini caught the bug**  
- **o1 missed it**

**o3-mini’s output**:
> "The code incorrectly uses `rows.length` instead of Python's `len(rows)` in `_load_csv_dataset`, which will raise an `AttributeError` when trying to determine the end index for slicing."

This is the kind of bug that requires domain understanding, not just syntax familiarity. o3-mini recognized the language-specific error and explained its runtime consequences—something o1 failed to do.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This benchmark shows a clear winner: **OpenAI o3-mini is significantly more effective at detecting real-world software bugs**.

- Use **o3-mini** for reasoning-heavy reviews, especially in languages with tricky semantics or lower training coverage.
- Use **o1** for lightweight validation or pattern-heavy codebases.

As more AI tools aim to assist with real code reviews, structured reasoning will be the next big differentiator.
