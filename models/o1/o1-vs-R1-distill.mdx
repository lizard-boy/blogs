## üß† Introduction

Large language models are starting to play a bigger role in software development‚Äînot just for generating code, but for reviewing it. One of the hardest and most valuable tasks they can assist with is **bug detection**: finding logic flaws that slip past linters, tests, and even human eyes.

In this post, we compare two models: **DeepSeek R1-distill** and **OpenAI o1**, to see how well they detect subtle, real-world bugs in code. The goal is simple: which model catches more issues, and in which languages do they shine?


## üß™ The Evaluation Dataset

I wanted to have the dataset of bugs to cover multiple domains and languages. I picked sixteen domains, picked 2-3 self-contained programs for each domain, and used Cursor to generate each program in TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust.

		].map((row, i) => (
			<tr
				key={i}
				style={{
					backgroundColor: 'var(--tw-prose-bg, white)',
					transition: 'background-color 0.2s'
				}}>
				<td

			</tr>
		))}
	</tbody>
</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.

## üìä Results

Across the full set of 210 files:

- **OpenAI o1** correctly identified **15 bugs**
- **DeepSeek R1-distill** found **37 bugs**

These aren't huge numbers‚Äîbut that‚Äôs expected. The bugs were intentionally hard to catch. What matters is the relative performance, and here, DeepSeek showed a clear edge.

### Language-Level Insights

- **Python:**  
  DeepSeek caught 4 bugs; o1 only found 2. In multiple cases, o1 struggled with async-related logic, while DeepSeek was able to reason through the control flow more effectively.

- **TypeScript:**  
  DeepSeek found 9 bugs; o1 caught 4. This gap suggests better handling of TypeScript‚Äôs strict typing and structural complexity on DeepSeek‚Äôs part.

- **Go:**  
  DeepSeek flagged 6 bugs; o1 found 2. Go‚Äôs concurrency model often requires deeper reasoning‚Äîsomething R1-distill seems better equipped to handle.

- **Rust:**  
  DeepSeek uncovered 9 bugs versus o1‚Äôs 3. Both models had a hard time with Rust‚Äôs strict compile-time checks, but DeepSeek still had the advantage.

- **Ruby:**  
  DeepSeek again led, catching 9 bugs compared to o1‚Äôs 4. Ruby‚Äôs metaprogramming and dynamic typing present challenges, but R1-distill managed to reason through several of them more effectively.

## üí° Observations

What stood out is that **DeepSeek‚Äôs lead widened in less commonly used or more complex languages**. That suggests its architecture‚Äîor possibly its training data‚Äîallows for stronger reasoning where surface-level pattern recognition fails.

While o1 is marketed as a reasoning model, DeepSeek‚Äôs output often showed a more methodical thought process, particularly in logic-heavy or stateful scenarios.

## üïµÔ∏è Example: Race Condition in a Smart Home System

One telling example came from a Go-based smart home notification service.

The bug involved a race condition: device updates were being broadcast without locking, which could result in inconsistent device states being shared with clients.

DeepSeek's response began with:

> ‚Äú\<think> Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the most critical bug in this code...‚Äù

And went on to reason through the code's flow, correctly identifying the lack of synchronization around device state changes.

OpenAI o1 missed the issue entirely.

This kind of bug isn‚Äôt obvious from structure alone‚Äîit requires a mental simulation of how the code would run. That‚Äôs exactly the kind of problem reasoning models are meant to solve.

## üß© Final Thoughts

DeepSeek R1-distill outperformed OpenAI o1 in every language we tested, and by a wide margin overall. While neither model is close to perfect, these results suggest that DeepSeek‚Äôs reasoning capabilities are more effective‚Äîespecially in spotting non-trivial bugs in more complex or less mainstream languages.

As AI code reviewers continue to evolve, we expect newer models like R1-distill to play an increasingly important role in real-world software verification. They're not replacing human reviewers yet‚Äîbut they're becoming powerful allies.
