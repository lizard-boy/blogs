## üß† Introduction

Subtle bugs in production code are notoriously hard to catch‚Äîand they‚Äôre often the most expensive. As large language models (LLMs) grow more capable, there's growing interest in using them for **AI-assisted code review and bug detection**.

Two models in particular‚Äî**OpenAI o1** and **DeepSeek R1**‚Äîhave drawn attention for their ability to reason about code. But which one is actually better at finding real-world bugs?

We ran a direct comparison to find out.

## üîç Test Setup

We created a dataset of **210 small programs** spanning sixteen domains, each containing a single subtle, realistic bug. These weren‚Äôt contrived syntax errors‚Äîthey were the kind of mistakes a professional developer might miss in a code review.

Each program was written in one of five languages: **Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust,** or **Ruby**.

Both models were prompted with the same buggy code, and asked to identify the issue.

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \`response\` variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.


## üìä Results

- **OpenAI o1** detected bugs in **15 out of 210** programs.
- **DeepSeek R1** identified **23 out of 210**.

While both models struggled with the most subtle bugs, DeepSeek R1 consistently outperformed o1 across most languages.

### Language Breakdown (selected highlights):

- **Go**: o1 caught 2 bugs; R1 found 3.  
- **Python**: o1 found 2 bugs; R1 caught 3.  
- **TypeScript**: o1 found 4 bugs; R1 caught 6.  
- **Rust**: o1 found 3 bugs; R1 caught 7.  
- **Ruby**: Both tied at 4 bugs each.

The most significant differences appeared in **Rust** and **TypeScript**, where DeepSeek R1 had a noticeable edge.

## üí° Observations

DeepSeek R1‚Äôs stronger performance may stem from several factors:

- **Training data**: R1 might have been trained on a more diverse or domain-specific dataset, especially for less mainstream languages like Rust or Go.
- **Architectural differences**: It‚Äôs possible R1 employs better intermediate reasoning or planning steps before generating responses, helping it simulate more of the logic flow.
- **Error heuristics**: Some of R1‚Äôs success might come from better recognizing high-level patterns or bug "signatures" in code.

Meanwhile, OpenAI o1 performed more consistently in common languages but struggled with concurrency bugs, misuse of async patterns, or dynamic behavior in less familiar languages.

## üß™ Interesting Bug: Ruby Audio Gain Miscalculation

One of the most revealing cases was from a Ruby audio processing library, where a bug involved incorrect gain calculation based on audio stretch rate.

OpenAI o1 missed the issue. DeepSeek R1 caught it‚Äîand gave a concise explanation:

> ‚ÄúThe bug in the TimeStretchProcessor class arose from using a static formula for gain adjustment, resulting in incorrect audio amplitude for varied stretch rates. By rationalizing the gain increment relative to the stretch rate, DeepSeek R1 highlighted the inconsistency that OpenAI o1 missed.‚Äù

This wasn‚Äôt a syntactic bug. It required understanding intent, simulating how the audio output would be affected, and catching a **conceptual flaw in the logic**‚Äîexactly the kind of task AI reviewers need to excel at.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

While both models show promise in automated bug detection, **DeepSeek R1 shows a clear edge**‚Äîespecially in languages like Rust and TypeScript, and in bugs that demand logical inference over pattern matching.

As reasoning models continue to evolve, they‚Äôre inching closer to becoming indispensable tools in the software verification pipeline. For now, DeepSeek R1 looks like a better bet when it comes to catching subtle, real-world bugs.
