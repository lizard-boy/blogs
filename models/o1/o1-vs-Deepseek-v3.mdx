## üß† Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assist in software development‚Äînot just for generating code, but for reviewing it. One of the most difficult and valuable tasks they can help with is **automated bug detection**.

We wanted to know: **how well do reasoning-capable LLMs actually perform at finding real bugs?**

To answer that, we tested two leading models‚Äî**DeepSeek v3** and **OpenAI o1**‚Äîon a dataset of realistic, hard-to-detect bugs across five programming languages. Here's what we found.

## üß™ The Evaluation Dataset

We built a dataset of **210 buggy programs**, spanning **sixteen domains** and written in **TypeScript, Ruby, Python, Go, and Rust**. Each program was generated using Cursor and then manually injected with a subtle bug‚Äîsomething realistic that could plausibly slip past linters, tests, and even a human reviewer.

The bugs were designed to be hard: logic errors, race conditions, async mishandling, and misuse of language-specific features.

</table>

Next I cycled through and introduced a tiny bug in each one. The type of bug I chose to introduce had to be:

1. A bug that a professional developer could reasonably introduce
2. A bug that could easily slip through linters, tests, and manual code review

Some examples of bugs I introduced:

1. Undefined \response\ variable in the ensure block
2. Not accounting for amplitude normalization when computing wave stretching on a sound sample
3. Hard coded date which would be accurate in most, but not all situations

At the end of this, I had 210 programs, each with a small, difficult-to-catch, and realistic bug.

A disclaimer: these bugs are the hardest-to-catch bugs I could think of, and are not representative of the median bugs usually found in everyday software.



## üìä Results

We ran both DeepSeek v3 and OpenAI o1 on the full dataset, asking them to identify the bug in each file.

- **Overall Performance**:
  - **DeepSeek v3**: 27 / 210 bugs detected  
  - **OpenAI o1**: 15 / 210 bugs detected

While both models struggled with the most subtle issues (as expected), DeepSeek v3 showed a consistent edge.

### By Language

- **Python**  
  - DeepSeek v3: 8 bugs  
  - OpenAI o1: 2 bugs  

- **TypeScript**  
  - Both models: 4 bugs  

- **Go**  
  - DeepSeek v3: 5 bugs  
  - OpenAI o1: 2 bugs  

- **Rust**  
  - DeepSeek v3: 5 bugs  
  - OpenAI o1: 3 bugs  

- **Ruby**  
  - DeepSeek v3: 5 bugs  
  - OpenAI o1: 4 bugs  

The biggest differences were in **Python** and **Go**, where DeepSeek‚Äôs reasoning ability seemed to help it navigate more complex async logic and concurrency patterns.

## üí° Thoughts

The performance gap can likely be explained by how each model handles **reasoning vs. pattern matching**.

OpenAI o1, while capable, relies more heavily on learned syntax and structural patterns. That works fine for more popular languages like TypeScript, but it breaks down when bugs require **understanding of control flow, concurrency, or async behavior**.

DeepSeek v3 appears to include stronger intermediate reasoning‚Äî‚Äúthinking before speaking.‚Äù This seems especially useful in catching bugs in less mainstream languages, where training data might be sparse and patterns are less predictable.

## üïµÔ∏è Interesting Bug: Async Cancellation Race Condition

A standout case was **Bug #1**, in a Python service using a CircuitBreaker.

The bug involved cancelling tasks without properly awaiting them, leading to unhandled exceptions and potential resource leaks. OpenAI o1 missed the issue. DeepSeek v3 caught it, and gave this reasoning:

> ‚ÄúThe most critical bug is in the CircuitBreaker.execute_request method where pending tasks are not properly awaited before cancellation, which could lead to unhandled exceptions and resource leaks when tasks are cancelled during timeout.‚Äù

This is the kind of bug that‚Äôs hard for traditional models to catch‚Äî**it‚Äôs not visible from syntax or structure alone**. It requires simulating the behavior of the program and understanding timing-related side effects.

## ‚úÖ Final Thoughts

DeepSeek v3 showed a **clear advantage** over OpenAI o1 in bug detection‚Äîespecially in languages that require reasoning about concurrency or async behavior.

While neither model is perfect, the results are promising. LLMs are already catching subtle bugs that most tools miss‚Äîand as reasoning capabilities continue to improve, AI code reviewers will become essential parts of the software development lifecycle.
