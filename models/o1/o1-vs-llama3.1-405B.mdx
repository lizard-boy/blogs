As AI code generation improves, the next big question is: **can AI review code too?** Bug detection is fundamentally harder than generation—it requires **reasoning**, not just pattern recognition. In this post, we benchmark two compact LLMs—**OpenAI o1** and **Meta Llama-3.1 405B**—on their ability to catch subtle bugs in code across multiple languages.

## 🧪 Evaluation Setup

We tested both models on a benchmark of **210 programs** spanning sixteen domains, each with a carefully planted logic bug. Languages included: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby.

The task: find the bug, given code and context. No retries or special prompting.

## 📊 Results

**Overall Bugs Caught**
- **Meta Llama-3.1 405B**: 24  
- **OpenAI o1**: 15

### By Language

- **Python**:  
  - Meta: 5  
  - OpenAI: 2  

- **TypeScript**:  
  - Meta: 8  
  - OpenAI: 4  

- **Go**:  
  - Meta: 5  
  - OpenAI: 2  

- **Rust**:  
  - Meta: 1  
  - OpenAI: 3  

- **Ruby**:  
  - Meta: 5  
  - OpenAI: 4  

Meta Llama-3.1 405B outperformed OpenAI o1 in **four out of five** languages—with **TypeScript** showing the largest margin. Only in Rust did OpenAI o1 slightly edge ahead.

## 💡 Analysis

The difference here comes down to **reasoning**.

- **Meta’s Llama-3.1 405B** uses a planning step before responding—allowing it to trace logic, assess consequences, and catch bugs that aren't obvious from syntax alone.
- **OpenAI o1**, while lighter and faster, depends more heavily on surface-level patterns—limiting its success when bugs involve complex logic or subtle misalignments.

This shows clearly in Ruby and Go, where reasoning through flow and concurrency helps uncover hidden errors. In contrast, o1 did slightly better in Rust—suggesting that in some edge cases, a smaller, more direct model can still win with the right pattern memory.

## 🐞 A Bug Worth Highlighting

### Test #1 — Ruby: Gain Calculation in Audio Processing

In the `TimeStretchProcessor` class of a Ruby audio library, a bug caused `normalize_gain` to be calculated using a fixed formula—ignoring the `stretch_factor`. This caused audio to be too loud or too quiet depending on speed.

- **Meta Llama-3.1 405B caught it**  
- **OpenAI o1 missed it**

Meta’s reasoning:
> "The gain should scale with the stretch_factor to preserve amplitude during speed changes. Using a fixed formula causes inconsistent output volume."

This wasn’t just a syntax slip—it was a **semantic failure**. Meta succeeded by reasoning through intent and effect. OpenAI o1 missed the connection.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

**Meta’s Llama-3.1 405B consistently outperforms OpenAI o1** for bug detection—especially in languages and tasks that require logical deduction.

- Choose **Llama-3.1 405B** if you're after better reasoning in your code reviews.
- Choose **OpenAI o1** if you need speed and don’t mind lower bug detection coverage.

As AI tooling continues to evolve, this benchmark suggests a future where **reasoning-first LLMs** will lead the charge in software verification.
