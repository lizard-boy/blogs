## Code Completion

### Cursor
Cursor offers advanced code completion through its Cursor Tab feature, providing intelligent suggestions for entire code blocks and multi-line changes. The system can modify existing code and adapts to recent changes and linter errors. Users can partially accept suggestions using Ctrl/⌘ →, with free users getting 2,000 suggestions and Pro users receiving unlimited access.

### Tabnine
Tabnine focuses on providing whole-line suggestions and full-function implementations that adapt as you type. It offers unique features like comment-to-code completions and partial completion acceptance. The system learns from your coding patterns and provides increasingly accurate suggestions over time.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### Cursor
Cursor integrates a sophisticated AI chat system directly into the editor, offering context-aware code discussions, multiple AI model support, and instant code block generation with apply functionality. The chat system preserves history, and automatically includes relevant file context, with added web search capabilities for up-to-date information.

### Tabnine
Tabnine Chat provides interactive AI coding assistance with code-aware conversations directly within the IDE. It includes code review capabilities and documentation assistance, though it's more focused on immediate code-related queries rather than broader development discussions.

## Context Awareness

### Cursor
Cursor excels in codebase understanding through automatic indexing and embeddings-based search for accurate code references. It offers customizable indexing rules via .cursorignore and maintains a privacy-focused design without plaintext code storage.

### Tabnine
Tabnine emphasizes personalization through learning from your coding patterns and project-specific suggestions. It offers team-wide code pattern recognition and custom fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for increasingly accurate context-aware suggestions over time.

## Privacy and Security

### Cursor
Cursor implements an optional Privacy Mode to prevent code storage, with no permanent storage of plaintext code. It offers local processing of sensitive information, transparent data handling policies, and configurable codebase indexing.

### Tabnine
Tabnine maintains strict security standards with end-to-end encryption, and no code sharing with third parties. It offers local processing options and private installation capabilities for enterprises, along with strict data handling protocols and secure code generation.
