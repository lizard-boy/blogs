## Code Completion

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody provides context-aware code completion that understands your entire codebase. It excels at maintaining consistent coding patterns and offers intelligent suggestions based on your repository's context. The completion system is particularly strong in multi-file scenarios and can handle complex code relationships through its Code Graph analysis.

### Codeium
Codeium offers advanced in-line and multi-line code completion with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capabilities. It adapts to your coding style and provides boilerplate code suggestions across various programming paradigms. The system is particularly notable for its speed and real-time suggestions.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody's chat functionality is deeply integrated with codebase context, featuring an @-mention system for retrieving specific context from files and symbols. It supports interactive debugging and provides context-aware suggestions for code improvements, making it particularly valuable for large codebases.

### Codeium
Codeium's Cascade feature provides an agentic chatbot experience with two distinct modes: Write and Chat. It maintains awareness of previous actions and can execute tasks directly within the IDE, offering a more interactive approach to problem-solving and code modification.

## Context Awareness

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody employs multiple context retrieval methods, including Keyword Search, Sourcegraph Search API, and Code Graph analysis. It offers comprehensive repository analysis and intelligent code understanding, making it particularly strong for enterprise-scale codebases.

### Codeium
Codeium uses contextually aware systems that adapt to your coding style and project requirements. While it offers good context awareness, it focuses more on immediate file context rather than the deep repository analysis that Cody provides.

## Privacy and Security

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody offers enterprise-grade security features with enhanced controls for business environments. The enterprise tier provides advanced security measures, repository-level permissions, and organizational control over data access.

### Codeium
Codeium emphasizes user privacy with configurable data sharing options. Users can opt out of code snippet telemetry, and the platform includes robust measures to protect personal information and code.
