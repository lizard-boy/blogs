## Code Completion

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody offers sophisticated code completion with context-aware suggestions drawn from your entire codebase. It maintains consistent coding patterns and reduces common errors through intelligent completion that understands both the local and global context of your code. The system integrates seamlessly across multiple IDEs and supports a wide range of programming languages.

### Replit AI
Replit's Complete Code feature provides contextual code suggestions activated by the tab key. It focuses on real-time suggestions within the Replit environment and is particularly strong in web development scenarios. The system is designed to be intuitive and works well within Replit's integrated development environment.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody's chat functionality is deeply integrated with codebase context, allowing developers to reference specific files and symbols using @-mentions. The chat system understands complex queries across multiple files and provides detailed, context-aware responses that incorporate knowledge from the entire codebase.

### Replit AI
Replit's AI Chat operates directly within the workspace, offering real-time coding help and continuous dialogue capabilities. It excels at providing immediate assistance and explanations, with features like the "Retry" option for alternative explanations and the ability to ask follow-up questions.

## Context Awareness

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody demonstrates superior context awareness through multiple context retrieval methods, including Keyword Search, Sourcegraph Search API, and Code Graph analysis. It maintains context across multiple repositories and supports remote file/directory access in the Enterprise tier, making it particularly powerful for large-scale development projects.

### Replit AI
Replit's context awareness is primarily focused within its web-based environment, providing strong understanding of the current workspace and open files. While more limited in scope compared to Cody, it excels at understanding the immediate context of the development environment and providing relevant assistance.
