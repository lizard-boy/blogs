## Code Completion

### Tabnine
Tabnine offers sophisticated code completion with whole-line and full-function suggestions. Its AI models adapt to your coding style and provide context-aware completions that can be accepted partially or completely. The tool excels at converting natural language comments into functional code and learns from your codebase to provide increasingly accurate suggestions.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev provides inline code suggestions with real-time completion recommendations through its autocomplete feature. It includes status bar integration with enable/disable toggle functionality and supports tab completion. The tool streams live diffs and offers an accept/reject interface for suggested changes.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### Tabnine
While specific chat features aren't explicitly detailed in Tabnine's documentation, it offers comment-to-code conversion capabilities and contextual assistance through its AI models. The focus appears to be more on integrated code completion rather than conversational interaction.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev features a robust built-in IDE chat interface that provides contextual code assistance without leaving the development environment. It supports interactive follow-up questions to refine responses and allows direct code integration from chat responses. The chat functionality is deeply integrated with the coding experience.

## Context Awareness

### Tabnine
Tabnine's AI models are designed to learn from your codebase and adapt to your coding style. The tool provides context-aware suggestions that improve over time through personalization and fine-tuning capabilities for specific use cases.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev demonstrates strong context awareness through its edit mode and actions features. It understands the surrounding code context and provides relevant suggestions for modifications, documentation, and testing based on the current codebase.
