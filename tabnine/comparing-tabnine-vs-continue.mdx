## Code Completion

### Tabnine
Tabnine offers sophisticated code completion with whole-line and full-function suggestions. Its AI models adapt to your coding style and provide context-aware completions that can be accepted partially or completely. The tool excels at converting natural language comments into functional code and learns from your codebase to provide increasingly accurate suggestions.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev provides inline code suggestions with real-time completion recommendations through its autocomplete feature. It includes status bar integration with enable/disable toggle functionality and supports tab completion. The tool streams live diffs and offers an accept/reject interface for suggested changes.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### Tabnine
While specific chat features aren't explicitly detailed in Tabnine's documentation, it offers comment-to-code conversion capabilities and contextual assistance through its AI models. The focus appears to be more on integrated code completion rather than conversational interaction.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev features a robust built-in IDE chat interface that provides contextual code assistance without leaving the development environment. It supports interactive follow-up questions to refine responses and allows direct code integration from chat responses. The chat functionality is deeply integrated with the coding experience.

## Context Awareness

### Tabnine
Tabnine's AI models are designed to learn from your codebase and adapt to your coding style. The tool provides context-aware suggestions that improve over time through personalization and fine-tuning capabilities for specific use cases.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev demonstrates strong context awareness through its edit mode and actions features. It understands the surrounding code context and provides relevant suggestions for modifications, documentation, and testing based on the current codebase.

## Privacy and Security

### Tabnine
Tabnine places a strong emphasis on privacy and security with multiple deployment options including cloud-based and self-hosted solutions. It features end-to-end encryption, protected universal models, and compliance with data protection regulations. The tool ensures code privacy with no unauthorized access to source code.

### Continue.dev
Continue.dev takes a transparent approach to security through its open-source nature. It offers self-hosted options and is transparent about model usage. The Apache 2.0 license ensures code visibility and security through community oversight.

## Pricing

### Tabnine
- **Basic Plan**: Entry-level features for individual developers
- **Dev Plan**: Enhanced features for professional developers
- **Pro Plan**: Advanced features for power users
- **Enterprise Plans (SaaS)**: Cloud-based team collaboration features
- **Enterprise Plans (Private Installation)**: On-premises deployment with maximum security

### Continue.dev

- **Model Costs**: Additional costs may apply depending on the chosen AI model:
  - **Claude**
  - **Codestral**
  - **ChatGPT**
  - **Llama**
  - **Mistral**
  - **Custom LLMs**

## Conclusion

Tabnine and Continue.dev serve different developer needs while both providing powerful AI-assisted coding capabilities. Tabnine positions itself as a premium, enterprise-ready solution with a strong focus on security, privacy, and specialized AI models. Its structured pricing tiers and deployment options make it particularly attractive for business environments where data protection is paramount.

Continue.dev, on the other hand, offers a more flexible, open-source approach with broader model integration options and a strong focus on developer interaction through its chat interface. Its free availability and support for multiple AI models make it an excellent choice for developers who want to experiment with different LLMs or require a more customizable solution. The choice between the two ultimately depends on your specific needs regarding privacy, customization, and budget constraints.
