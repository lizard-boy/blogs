## Code Completion

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot offers sophisticated real-time code completion powered by OpenAI's technology. It provides whole-line and full-function completions with support for multiple programming languages. The tool excels at understanding context from your codebase and can convert comments into functional code. Its suggestions are particularly strong for repetitive patterns and boilerplate code.

### Continue
Continue provides intelligent code completion with inline suggestions and tab completion support. Its open-source nature allows for customization of the completion experience. The tool offers streaming diff previews and highlight-and-edit functionality, making it easier to accept or modify suggestions. A unique feature is its ability to work with multiple AI models, providing flexibility in choosing the completion engine.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### GitHub Copilot
Copilot's chat feature is deeply integrated into IDEs and accessible through GitHub.com and mobile apps. It offers natural language coding assistance, detailed code explanations, debugging help, and architecture suggestions. The chat interface can handle complex queries and provide context-aware responses based on your codebase.

### Continue
Continue's chat integration focuses on maintaining developer workflow by providing an integrated AI chat interface within the IDE. It supports follow-up questions and iterative improvements, allowing developers to refine their queries without switching contexts. The chat system is designed for real-time responses and can be customized to work with different AI models.
