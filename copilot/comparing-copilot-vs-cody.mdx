## Code Completion

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot offers real-time code suggestions as you type, providing whole-line and full-function completions across multiple programming languages. Its strength lies in understanding context from your codebase and providing inline suggestions that maintain consistency with your coding style. The tool excels at repetitive code patterns and can convert comments to functional code.

### Sourcegraph Cody
Sourcegraph Cody provides context-aware code completion with a focus on maintaining consistency with existing codebases. It leverages multiple context retrieval methods, including Keyword Search and Code Graph analysis, to provide more accurate suggestions. The tool is particularly strong in understanding repository-wide patterns and generating style-consistent code.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot's chat functionality is available directly in IDEs, through GitHub.com, and via mobile apps. It offers natural language coding assistance, code explanations, debugging help, and architecture suggestions. The chat interface can handle complex queries and provide detailed explanations of code functionality.

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody's chat interface is deeply integrated with its context understanding capabilities. It features an @-mention system for adding specific context from files, symbols, and repositories. The chat can handle multi-file context for complex queries and provides intelligent responses based on comprehensive codebase analysis.

## Context Awareness

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot processes context from your current file, open editors, and related project files. It maintains context awareness across different file types and can understand project-wide patterns. The tool excels at suggesting code that fits within the existing project structure and coding conventions.

### Sourcegraph Cody
Sourcegraph Cody takes a more comprehensive approach to context, utilizing multiple retrieval methods including Keyword Search, Sourcegraph Search API, and Code Graph analysis. It can understand context across entire repositories and maintain awareness of code relationships, making it particularly strong for large-scale codebases.

## Privacy and Security

### GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot emphasizes privacy with local processing of code suggestions, compliance with GitHub's privacy policy, and enterprise-grade security measures. It offers data encryption standards and doesn't store personal code. Users have the option to disable telemetry, and enterprise customers get additional security controls.

### Sourcegraph Cody
Cody provides enterprise-grade security controls with scalable infrastructure and organizational control over data access. It features repository-level permissions and secure context handling, making it suitable for sensitive enterprise environments.
