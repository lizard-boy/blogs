## Code Completion

### Windsurf
Windsurf offers sophisticated code completion with contextually aware in-line and multi-line suggestions. It adapts to your coding style and provides boilerplate code, snippets, and fill-in-the-middle completions. The system leverages advanced LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to ensure high-quality, relevant suggestions across different development scenarios.

### Continue
Continue provides intelligent code completion with inline suggestions as you type. It features streaming diff previews and highlight-and-edit functionality, allowing developers to accept or reject changes in real-time. The system integrates deeply with your codebase to provide context-aware completions, and includes a status bar integration for quick enabling/disabling.

## AI Chat Capabilities

### Windsurf
Windsurf's Cascade feature offers an agentic chatbot that maintains awareness of previous actions. It provides two distinct modes: Write for direct codebase modifications, and Chat for general inquiries and discussions. The integration allows developers to interact with AI assistance without leaving their IDE environment.

### Continue
Continue offers an integrated AI chat interface within the IDE that supports follow-up questions and iterative improvements. The chat system provides real-time responses to coding queries and maintains context throughout the conversation, making it effective for complex problem-solving scenarios.

## Context Awareness

### Windsurf
Windsurf demonstrates strong context awareness through its code completion engine, which understands both local and broader project context. It provides relevant suggestions based on your current file, imported libraries, and overall project structure, making it particularly effective for complex codebases.

### Continue
Continue excels in custom context integration, allowing developers to build custom autocomplete experiences. It maintains context across chat sessions and code completions, with full codebase awareness that enables more accurate and relevant suggestions.
