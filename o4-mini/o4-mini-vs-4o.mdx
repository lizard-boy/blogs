## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, leveraging AI models like OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) for software verification and bug detection is gaining momentum. While code generation has been a significant focus, bug detection presents a materially different challenge, requiring nuanced understanding and reasoning capabilities. This post compares two AI models, OpenAI: o4-mini and OpenAI: 4o, to determine their effectiveness in identifying complex bugs in software programs.

## Results

We conducted tests on two models, OpenAI: o4-mini and OpenAI: 4o, to assess their abilities to detect hard bugs across various programming languages such as Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. The results revealed interesting insights:

- **Overall Performance:** Out of the 210 bugs, OpenAI: o4-mini detected 15, while OpenAI: 4o managed to discover 20. This indicates a general trend of OpenAI: 4o performing slightly better.

- **Language-specific Performance:**
  - **Python:** OpenAI: o4-mini caught 4/42 bugs, while OpenAI: 4o caught 6/42.
  - **TypeScript:** OpenAI: o4-mini identified 2/42 bugs, whereas OpenAI: 4o found 4/42.
  - **Go:** OpenAI: o4-mini managed to catch 3/42 bugs, while OpenAI: 4o identified 4/42.
  - **Rust:** OpenAI: o4-mini managed to catch 4/42 bugs, while OpenAI: 4o identified 3/42.
  - **Ruby:** OpenAI: o4-mini showed better performance in Ruby, catching 6/42 compared to OpenAI: 4o’s 3/42.

These results suggest varying capabilities of the models across different languages, influenced by the language’s popularity and the complexity of the bugs.

## Thoughts

The comparative advantage of OpenAI: 4o in detecting more bugs, particularly in languages such as Python and Go, indicates that its model architecture might be more robust in handling concurrency issues and complex logic errors. This could be attributed to a better integrated reasoning step which aids in identifying logical fallacies or oversight that are not purely syntactical.

Conversely, for less mainstream languages such as Ruby, which may have less representation in the training data, OpenAI: o4-mini's ability to reason through code and deduce errors, despite lacking the brute capabilities, allowed it to outperform its counterpart in some instances.

The discrepancy in performance across languages points to a potential influence of LLM training data distribution—Python and TypeScript, often being more prevalent and standardized, might offer easier pattern recognition for these models.

## Interesting Bugs

In the domain of Ruby, an interesting bug was identified by OpenAI: o4-mini but missed by OpenAI: 4o.

- **Test Number:** Ruby Test
- **Bug Description:** The bug involved incorrect gain calculation in a Ruby audio processing library (TimeStretchProcessor class). Instead of adapting the gain based on the stretch factor—representing how much audio is sped up or slowed down—a fixed formula was used, leading to erroneous amplitude adjustments.
- **Reasoning Output:** OpenAI: o4-mini identified that the gain needed to be scaled relative to the stretch to ensure consistent audio levels. This required a conceptual understanding of audio processing beyond mere syntax error detection.
- **Model Analysis:** The success of OpenAI: o4-mini in this instance underscores its ability to integrate reasoning at a conceptual level, recognizing the mathematical logic needed for correct gain adjustment—a trait potentially linked to the model’s capacity for planning steps before generation.

In conclusion, the varying performance of OpenAI: o4-mini versus OpenAI: 4o across languages suggests different strengths in bug detection related to pattern recognition and logical reasoning. This analysis is a step toward understanding how future AI models can be developed with enhanced capabilities for software verification.
