In recent years, the application of large language models (LLMs) in software verification has shown promising results, especially in detecting bugs that human eyes might miss. As the technology continues to evolve, the pursuit of perfecting bug detection capabilities remains a critical focus. This post investigates and compares two such models—OpenAI: o4-mini and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7—to evaluate their proficiency in identifying hard-to-spot bugs in software programs. 

## Results

In our tests, we ran 210 bug instances through both OpenAI's o4-mini and Anthropic's Sonnet 3.7 models to gauge their bug detection capabilities. Sonnet 3.7 detected 32 bugs, whereas the o4-mini detected 15. This broad gap reflects a potential advantage in Sonnet 3.7’s reasoning capabilities, leveraged through its planning phase before output generation.

### Performance by Programming Language

1. **Python**: In Python, both Sonnet 3.7 and o4-mini showed comparable performances, detecting 4 and 5 bugs respectively out of 42 instances.
2. **TypeScript**: Sonnet 3.7 outperformed o4-mini significantly, catching 9 bugs compared to 2.
3. **Go**: Sonnet 3.7 identified 6 bugs, while o4-mini managed to catch only 1 out of the 42 presented.
4. **Rust**: Sonnet 3.7 continued its strong performance with 6 detected bugs, versus 3 by o4-mini.
5. **Ruby**: Once again, Sonnet 3.7 surpassed o4-mini by catching 7 bugs compared to o4-mini’s 4 out of 42.

The results highlight Sonnet 3.7’s superior performance across most languages with a significant edge in TypeScript and Go.

## Thoughts

The promising results from Sonnet 3.7 can be attributed to its enhanced reasoning process, which involves a structured planning phase before generating responses. This procedure could be instrumental in rationalizing the logic of less frequently encountered syntactical patterns in languages like Ruby and Rust. Meanwhile, o4-mini's training predominantly focused on more common languages like Python and TypeScript, allowing it to perform pattern matching effectively but limiting its ability to engage in complex reasoning.

The disparity in performance emphasizes the importance of training LLMs on diverse datasets and equipping them with reasoning capabilities for better understanding and logic application—elements critical in identifying bugs.

## Interesting Bugs

One standout example involved detecting a race condition within a Go-based smart home notification system. Here, the bug was that there was no synchronizing lock around device updates. This could potentially lead to race conditions, with clients receiving stale device states.

Test Number: 2   
Reasoning Output: "The most critical bug in this code was no locking around device updates before broadcasting, leading to potential race conditions where clients receive stale or partially updated device state."

While o4-mini missed this critical bug, Sonnet 3.7 successfully identified it. This can be attributed to Sonnet 3.7's thinking phase, allowing for a better understanding of logic and sequence of operations, which is crucial in detecting synchronization issues.

### Conclusion

Overall, the capabilities of language models in bug detection show exciting advancements, with Sonnet 3.7 exhibiting a remarkable ability to identify intricate software issues across different programming languages. By continuing to expand training datasets and refining logical reasoning steps, such models can become even more proficient, vastly enhancing software verification processes. As we tread further into this realm, the potential for AI and LLMs in software development is immense, paving the way for more effective and efficient coding practices.
