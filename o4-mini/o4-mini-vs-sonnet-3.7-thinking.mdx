## Introduction

As the field of artificial intelligence advances, the potential for machine learning models to aid in software development has become increasingly prominent. One particular area of interest is the ability of these models to detect bugs in software programs. In this blog post, we will explore the bug detection capabilities of two language learning models (LLMs), OpenAI: o4-mini and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking. Our focus is on evaluating which model performs better in catching difficult bugs across various programming languages.

## Results

In our analysis, we tested both models across a diverse set of programming languages: Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, and Ruby. The results of our tests are summarized as follows:

- **Overall**: Out of 210 bugs, Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking identified 21, while OpenAI: o4-mini identified 15. While both models struggled, Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking had a slight edge.
  
- **Python**: OpenAI: o4-mini identified 5 out of 42 bugs, and Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking identified 2 out of 42. OpenAI showed better performance in Python.
  
- **TypeScript**: Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking identified 5 out of 42 bugs, compared to OpenAI: o4-mini's 2 out of 42. Anthropic slightly outperformed OpenAI here.
  
- **Go**: Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking correctly identified 4 out of 42 bugs, whereas OpenAI: o4-mini caught 1. Anthropic had an edge in Go.
  
- **Rust**: Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking discovered 5 out of 41 bugs, whereas OpenAI: o4-mini found 3. Anthropic marginally led in Rust.
  
- **Ruby**: Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking detected 5 out of 42 bugs, and OpenAI: o4-mini found 4. Here, Anthropic barely edged ahead.

These results indicate nuanced performance differences across languages, with neither model demonstrating consistent superiority across the board.

## Thoughts

The variance in performance between the two models can be partially attributed to their underlying architectures. Anthropic's reasoning model employs a thinking step before generating a response, which may contribute to its success in scenarios requiring deeper logical reasoning, as seen in programming languages that rely on unique paradigms like Go and Ruby. In contrast, OpenAI's model demonstrates proficiency in Python, possibly due to Python's popularity and resultant abundance of training data.

The differential performance in TypeScript and Python could be influenced by the models' ability to detect patterns. Python is well-known and well-supported by large datasets, which could explain OpenAI's competency in identifying pattern-based bugs without deep logical reasoning. Conversely, less common languages like Ruby and Go can benefit from Anthropic's logical reasoning, which aids in revealing hard-to-detect bugs.

## Interesting Bugs

One notable bug was identified in a Ruby audio processing library (Test No. X), where incorrect gain calculation led to amplitude errors. Here, Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking successfully detected the bug while OpenAI: o4-mini did not. According to Anthropic's reasoning output: "The bug in the TimeStretchProcessor class incorrectly calculates normalize_gain based on a fixed formula rather than the stretch_factor, leading to wrong amplitude levels in the output audio."

The reasoning mechanism of Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking could logically assess relationships within the code context, identifying deviations from expected patterns or logical flow. OpenAI: o4-mini's reliance on pattern recognition perhaps couldn't effectively address this logic-driven bug, highlighting the importance of reasoning steps in complex scenarios.

In summary, while Anthropic: Sonnet 3.7 thinking shows proficiency in logical reasoning, OpenAI: o4-mini's strengths lie in detecting pattern-based bugs in more mainstream languages. This underscores the importance of strategically employing AI models tailored to specific contexts or languages.
