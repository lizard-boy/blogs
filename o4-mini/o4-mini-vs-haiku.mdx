## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the advent of AI models like OpenAI's o4-mini and Anthropic's Haiku offers promising new capabilities in code analysis and bug detection. Given the increasing complexity of modern codebases, automatically detecting hard-to-find software bugs is both crucial and challenging. This blog post delves into the comparative performance of two language models, OpenAI: o4-mini and Anthropic: Haiku, in identifying difficult bugs in software programs.

## Results

In a series of tests examining each model's ability to catch hard bugs, the models were scored across multiple programming languages. The results were as follows:

- **Overall Performance:**
  - Anthropic: Haiku discovered a total of 29 bugs.
  - OpenAI: o4-mini found 15 bugs.

### Performance by Language

- **Python:**
  - Anthropic: Haiku found 4 bugs out of 42.
  - OpenAI: o4-mini found 5 bugs out of 42.

- **TypeScript:**
  - Anthropic: Haiku discovered 6 bugs out of 42.
  - OpenAI: o4-mini discovered 2 bugs out of 42.

- **Go:**
  - Anthropic: Haiku detected 6 bugs out of 42.
  - OpenAI: o4-mini detected 1 bug out of 42.

- **Rust:**
  - Anthropic: Haiku caught 5 bugs out of 41.
  - OpenAI: o4-mini caught 3 bugs out of 41.

- **Ruby:**
  - Anthropic: Haiku discovered 8 bugs out of 42.
  - OpenAI: o4-mini discovered 4 bugs out of 42.

Across these languages, Anthropic: Haiku outperformed OpenAI: o4-mini, particularly noticeable in TypeScript, Go, and Ruby, where the difference in bug detection was more pronounced.

## Thoughts

The results suggest that Anthropic's Haiku is generally more effective at identifying hard bugs across various programming languages. One possible reason for this superior performance is the model architecture: Haiku's reasoning models incorporate a thinking phase that likely assists in deeper code analysis, thereby improving its bug detection capability. In contrast, OpenAI's o4-mini seems to leverage pattern matching more, which may limit its ability in languages where large datasets and training examples are less prevalent.

For languages like TypeScript and Python, which are widely used, the advantage of a reasoning step may be less impactful due to abundant training data available to both models, making pattern matching alone somewhat effective. However, for less common languages like Ruby and Rust, the reasoning component might be contributing significantly to Haiku's superior performance, providing logical insights beyond simple patterns.

## Interesting Bugs

### Python Bug: Discrepancy in Type Handling (Test #29)

In an interesting case from the Python dataset, Anthropic: Haiku managed to catch a bug in test number 29 which OpenAI: o4-mini missed. The problem was in the method `_calculate_distance_matrix`, which inadvertently awaited a list, leading to a 'list object is not awaitable' TypeError. Haiku's output correctly identifies the mistake:

> "In `BioinformaticsToolkit.build_phylogenetic_tree`, the code does `await self._calculate_distance_matrix(sequences)` even though `_calculate_distance_matrix` is a normal (non-async) method, so awaiting its list return value throws a 'list' object is not awaitable TypeError."

The core issue was a misuse of asynchronous programming constructs, showcasing Haiku's ability to evaluate method intent versus implementation. This capability to infer logical and architectural discrepancies suggests that reasoning models like Haiku may offer crucial insights, particularly for bugs arising from conceptual misunderstandings rather than simple code syntax or structure errors.

In conclusion, the comparative analysis reiterates the promise that AI-driven reasoning models hold for debugging complex code, highlighting the potential for improving software reliability and developer productivity through more intuitive and context-aware artificial intelligence systems.
